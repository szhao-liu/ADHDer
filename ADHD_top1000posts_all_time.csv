1hf8k5t,My son's ADHD saved his sister's life,None,15201,2024-12-15 18:05:27,417,"My son was only 7 years old when he took a picture of his little sister on his new tablet. He noticed something. One eye was red, one eye was white? He has always hyper fixated on patterns, or differences in things. This has had its ups and downs. He will ask larger people why they are fat (at 5.5 years old- sorry nurse at the ER at some hospital in Flint, MI) or point out someone's physical disability. He means well, he is just fascinated and curious. He has an IEP at school and has a ""combined"" ADHD diagnosis, a ""learning disability"" and ""other trauma and stressor related"" disorder.

My daughter was diagnosed with retinoblastoma ( rare form of pediatric eye cancer) because of this picture, alone. She had her 3 year well child visit less than 2 months prior to her diagnosis.

She had an enucleation, and having told the surgeon and eye specialist the story of why she was diagnosed, she said to tell my 7 year old son he saved his little sister's life. She was in tears when she told me the tumor was a mere 1-2 mm ( THATS MILLIMETERS Y'ALL) from spreading to her brain via her optic nerve. 6 rounds of chemo and she has made one heck of a recovery. She did lose her hair, her right eye and she does struggle in school a bit. Chemo has some nasty side effects, even years down the road from treatment. She doesn't remember having two eyes. As sad as it is, it's worked in her favor.

She is now 6 years old, and in 1st grade. Her brother still has his little sister, and he is my super hero, forever!!  

EDIT/ADDED AFTER- Wow I am so shocked by the attention this has gotten. YES my son absolutely saved his little sister. I have never once said it was his ADHD that saved her. Honestly, it was just a catchy title. Thank you so much for your kind words, and concern that my son may have been misdiagnosed. I promise you all, he is very loved, and no one on this earth cares more about his health and well being. That being said, I don't think him having any other diagnosis would result in any difference in his treatment plan. He has multiple Drs who reassure me that I am taking all of the correct steps, and that additional testing is not necessary, as of right now. I will continue to advocate for all of my children, and I hope this made your day when you read it :) thanks again.

pelip6,How I cured my adhd permanently,VitaminNutrient,12813,2021-08-30 09:25:28,884,"I've been suffering from adhd my whole life, for about 26 years now. And when I was at work a very close friend of mine told me something that cured my adhd, I have no symptoms since then. All he said was one sentence, and I mean it when I tell you this saved my life:

""Just use a planner""

I was shocked when he said this, and my adhd went away as soon as he finished that sentence. I started focusing like crazy. Guys try this out.

&#x200B;

If you didn't notice this is satire, but I'm tired of hearing that shit over and over again, I'm at the point where I make fun of it because of how bad the advice is.",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/pelip6/how_i_cured_my_adhd_permanently/,True,False
1k2y6x8,The ADHD symptom that finally made people stop saying “everyone does that”.,Same_Membership_2144,12068,2025-04-19 08:00:33,1696,"I was diagnosed with ADHD recently as an adult, and since then I’ve had a lot of conversations with people who ask what my symptoms are. Often, when I describe something, the response is:  
“But everyone has that”.

Honestly that doesn't bother me and I would have said the same thing before I was diagnosed. 

But then I tell them this:  
I can be in the middle of a 1 on 1 conversation with my manager, talking about something that I'm actually interested in. He's speaking directly to me, and I'll have a random tangential thought. Thirty seconds later I will zone back into the conversation because I need to respond to him, and have to guess what he was talking about.

Not one person has said ""everybody does that"". ",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1k2y6x8/the_adhd_symptom_that_finally_made_people_stop/,False,False
ioi1my,I went through 700 reddit comments and collected 131 ADHD pro-tips!,beatadhd,9589,2020-09-07 15:53:57,623,"So there was that awesome [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ifsln9/lets_share_lifechanging_adhd_tips_that_weve/?sort=top) with a bunch of ADHD'ers sharing **real tips** that have changed their life.

I thought it was a great change from most advice on the internet which is written by non-ADHD'ers (and it's painfully obvious that it is).

I read through the 700+ comments and paraphrased, merged and categorised all the tips.

&#x200B;

The 131 tips are split into the following categories:

* General
* Cleaning
* Memory
* Time Blindness
* Distractions
* Getting Things Done
* Emotional Dysregulation
* Sleep
* Relationships
* Work
* School
* Executive Function
* Nutrition/Medication

# General

* Pack things the day before so you don’t forget \~ **(**u/digi-cow**)**
* Don’t drink alcohol. Causes brain fog and it can negatively interact with medications. Alcohol can even cause ADHD-like symptoms in non-ADHD people \~ **(**u/HiTechTek**,** u/beatadhd)
* Do Cardio before you need to do stuff that requires sitting. It helps you focus. \~ **(**u/robertaloblaw**,** u/beatadhd)
* Use text-to-speech generators to help you read webpages/books \~ **(**u/elliptical_orbit**)**
* Keep things at eye level (Especially notes/todo lists) \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* Be stupidly early to places just in case you forget something \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* Stretch once in awhile. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Take a deep breath. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Take a cold shower in the morning or turn it cold just for 30-60 seconds at the end of your shower. Wakes you up, gets your blood flowing and gets you out of the shower. \~ **(**u/Juan_Creamsicle**,** u/beatadhd)
* Get a therapist if you can. \~ **(**u/fineandnormal**)**
* If you aren’t diagnosed: Actually get a diagnosis and a therapeutic programme that works for you. Don’t spend more time wondering - you’ll still feel like an imposter afterwards, don’t worry… \~ **(**u/Little_Blue_Shed**)**
* Most important for me has been telling myself all I need to do is floss. Usually you'll end up chaining the rest of your night routine tasks like brushing onto that. \~ **(**u/amazona_auropalliata**)**
* Buy a whiteboard to sketch out things when your mind starts going into overdrive. \~ **(**u/bkmilli**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Enjoy the journey more than the destination, don’t be in a hurry to finish something you are doing, but always at least do something small everyday. Life is not a race, rather, it is an accumulation of smaller improvements to oneself. \~ **(**u/ksettle**)**  
>  
>*People are in such a rush these days… You can’t expect to become a superhuman overnight. Focus on sustainability first and enjoy the journey.*

# Cleaning

* Have a designated spot for every single item (Put it in the same place every time) \~ **(**u/BrownShoeJenny**)**
* Have a “misc” basket in each room. If you’re truly unable to put something away, put it in the basket. Have a designated period of time, once a week, when your sole priority is to put everything away, all at once. \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Whenever you lose something that you “put away,” start keeping it in the first place you looked for it. \~ **(**u/FullDisclosureDaemon**)**
* In order to not get overwhelmed when cleaning, remember there are only 5 things you need to tackle: Trash, Laundry, Dishes, Putting things back that have a place, Put things in a pile that don’t have a place. \~ **(**u/mmc09**)**
* If you’re moving from one room to another, take the item with you that needs to go to the other room. It’s already on your way and it’s one less thing cluttering your room. \~ **(**u/SweetTeaBags**)**
* If you can afford it: Get a cleaning person; It takes them 3 hours to do what you can do in 3 weeks. While they are there, use them as an accountability buddy and sort out your misc tasks like paying bills. \~ **(**u/swarleyknope**)**
* Embrace chaos. Let your brain get distracted when you’re cleaning. Cleaning dishes and stop spare trash? It’s fine go clean that and then get back to the dishes \~ **(**u/DobbythehouseElff**)**
* Have a dedicated playlist for cleaning. High tempo songs help keep you moving. \~ **(**u/DobbythehouseElff**)**
* Do chores before you go to bed. No matter what your routine is, you have to go to bed at some point. You can “habit-chain” cleaning into going to bed. \~ **(**u/bkmilli**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Listen to podcasts/audiobooks when doing chores. My excitement to listen to a new episode of my favorite podcast motivates me to do boring stuff like dishes or laundry. (I personally listen to podcasts) \~ **(**u/dani-tp**)**  
>  
>*Cleaning became so easy once I started using a “side” to stimulate my brain. I’m mostly watching TV shows when I clean right now (this also works for cooking!) .*

# Memory

* Having a tablet like an iPad Pro is helpful for keeping colorful notes. Avoids issues losing notebooks \~ **(**u/zombiessalad**)**
* Park in the same place every time when you go to a common place. You won’t forget where you park that way \~ **(**u/gibbousboi**)**
* Keep a spare house key in your car and one outside your house. \~ **(**u/GoodGuyVik**)**
* Keep important items in visible and convenient locations. e.g: Take pills when you eat? Keep your bottle beside your table where you eat. \~ **(**u/girlabout2fallasleep**)**
* Get a Tile. Bluetooth GPS trackers that are a game changer for ADHD people that lose keys/wallets. \~ **(**u/fizzzzzpop**)**
* Tape your most often made recipes to the inside of your kitchen cabinet doors. \~ **(Unknown)**
* Three point check when you close the front door: Phone, wallet, keys \~ **(**u/cowboyhugbees**)**
* Use voice assistants. “Remind me to do X tomorrow at Y time” \~ **(**u/theviciousfish**)**
* Use the mind palace memory exercise to help solve retention issues. \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* Keep forgetting your lunch? Put your keys on it. That way you can’t leave without your lunch \~ **(**u/Therealdickbut**,** u/Maktube, u/mismanager)
* If you need to remember to bring something with you the next day, place it right in front of the exit door so you HAVE to touch it before you leave the house. If it’s something in the fridge, put a sticky note on the exit door’s handle. \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Buy multiple items that you use often. Setup multiple chargers at work/home (so you have a spare if you lose one). e.g. buy 10 different lip balms so you can always find it when you need it. \~ **(**u/redbananass**)**
* Have convenient, labeled spaces for things. It’s hard to forget your phone when you ALWAYS put it beside your charger. (Use a cheap labelmaker!) \~ **(**u/TotallyLegitEstoc**,** u/nathanb131)
* Get a tracking tool like Tile and put it on things you lose regularly. (Keys/Wallet) \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* Have rules for placement of the important things in your life. (it’s too hard to do it for everything) \~ **(**u/nathanb131**)**
* Create a second brain for yourself - in whatever way is most appealing to you. (I personally use Notion) \~ (u/significanttoday**)**
* If you want to remember something, put an object out-of-place whilst thinking about what you want to remember. \~ **(**u/VectorGambiteer**)**
* Count your steps as you walk into a new room. It’ll help you remember why you entered that room. It gives you something to focus on but it’s not too much that you’ll get distracted. (This is similar to many forms of counting meditations too) \~ **(**u/bethknowsbest**)**
* Use a bowl to throw your keys, badges, and wallet into when you get home. That way you can’t leave without ALL the stuff you need. \~ **(**u/pockunit**)**
* ALWAYS have a bag with the essentials. On mine a have my keys, charger, papers and even tooth brush. If I’m going out, I do not waste time searching for everything. Just search for a bag. \~ **(**u/sdjrp**)**
* Make a calendar entry for every scheduled thing religiously unless it’s routine like a 9-5 job. Make the calendar entry immediately while making the appointment. Do this for parties, birthdays, dates, finals, med refills, trash night, etc. \~ **(**u/percyjeandavenger**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Use Spaced Repetition to study for your exams, remember things about people in your life, and literally everything you can possibly make a flashcard for. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**  
>  
>*Is it narcisstic to put my own tip as a favourite? Well who cares, it works! Spaced repetition is fantastic and honestly* ***feels like cheating***\*. There are a lot of free tools out there which work great. I’m currently using my own private tool\* 😉

# Time Blindness

* Set your phone clock 10-15 mins fast on purpose \~ **(**u/Anonredditthoughts**)**
* Put appointments in your calendar 10-20 minutes earlier than the actual appointment \~ **(**u/Alyscupcakes**)**
* A schedule is only as good as the alarms and info you put in \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* Set timers for activites you hyperfocus on. BUT set the timer for X minutes less than the task takes. (Give yourself time to wrap up whatever you’re working on) Additional Protip: Use this on a watch rather than your phone to avoid getting distracted. A basic watch/smart watch will save your life. \~ **(**u/dinamyte519**)**
* Download an app on your phone that chimes and buzzes every half an hour during your awake time. Keeps you aware of how much time has passed. \~ **(**u/Frosty172**)**
* Track your time. Every morning, write out a todo list by hand and track the time taken for each task. (Write down the time whenever you take a break or switch tasks) - I personally use Toggl to track my time \~ **(**u/ImprovedMeyerLemon**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Get an electric toothbrush with a timer. ADHD people have time blindness and it’ll make sure you brush for at least two minutes. \~ **(**u/insaxon**)**  
>  
>*Yes. Two minutes can feel like two hours for me. Or I’ll brush for 20 seconds and think five minutes has passed. I can’t trust my brain, so I started using an electric toothbrush with a timer*

# Distractions

* Disable all your notifications on your phone except for essential apps (Texting, Voicemail, Calendar) \~ **(**u/kee_kee**)**
* Use website blockers for distracting websites *(I use Cold Turkey, Freedom and News Feed removers for social media + Youtube)* \~ **(**u/elliptical_orbit**)**
* Get a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones + non-distracting music/audio \~ **(**u/elliptical_orbit**,** u/michaeltheobnoxious)
* If you can’t stop yourself from answering that text/email/IM right away but don’t actually have time to deal with it, tell the person you’ll respond when you get a minute. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Your brain focuses better after some exercise. *Cardio works best* \~ **(**u/unofficialuser112**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Use a noise-cancelling headset and listen to music/white noise/brown noise. Enables hyperfocus and blocks out distractions (“I don’t regret getting diagnosed late, but I do regret getting noise cancelling headphones that late in life.”) \~ **(**u/rn7889**)**  
>  
>*Stop scrolling right now and go buy the noise-cancelling headset. A noise-cancelling headset + some noise like music/brown noise is essential if you have ADHD. Feel free to thank me later once your life changes.*  
>  
>*If the headset isn't in your budget: Brown noise + earphones will get you 80% of the way there.*

# Getting Things Done

* If you have an Android: Put a widget from your todo list app on your home screen so it’s the first thing you see \~ **(**u/kee_kee**)**
* Break tasks down into as many smaller tasks as you need for it to feel manageable. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Learn to plan around transitions. It’s easier to start things if you chain them with another task that is ending. \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Use the pomodoro technique for everything. It’s great having a break to look forward to. \~ **(**u/ontapeina_sthrnaccnt**)**
* Remember that something is better than nothing. If you only get 26% of a task done then it’s further than if you never started. It’s better to do little bits of every task rather than procrastinating. \~ **(**u/xxxistentialist**)**
* Attach numbers to events. e.g: Going to bed (3) - Brush, Floss, Mouthwash. \~ **(**u/Frosty172**)**
* Lie to yourself. I’ll tell myself that I’m just going to unload one dish from the dishwasher. Once I’ve started, I’ll at least unload a few, and maybe clean the whole kitchen. \~ **(**u/coffeeclichehere**)**
* Decide what you’re going to do each day beforehand, preferably while your meds are at their workingest. Make sure it’s only 1 thing. \~ **(**u/optimisticaspie**)**
* Understand that FUTURE YOU IS STILL YOU. If you think you’ll do something later, understand that future you is still you. Future you isn’t more likely to muster up the desire to do the work. f you don’t have the motivation to do it in the next 24 hours then future you probably won’t either. \~ **(**u/Moon_In_Scorpio**)**
* When you need to transition between tasks, pretend that you are talking to a friend who is having issues with something. Give yourself a nudge and remind yourself it’s time to switch tasks/get started. (Detach yourself from the task) \~ **(**u/Gerryislandgirl**)**
* When you take breaks, make sure your break isn’t too interesting. That way you won’t get absorbed in your break. Just clean during your break or something like that. \~ **(**u/Treppenwitz_shitz**)**
* Gamify things and set a limited amount of time to accomplish something. e.g: Brew your coffee and get as many chores done as you can before the coffee is finished brewing. \~ **(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)**
* Write TODO lists as a brain dump. And then order them in importance or the order you want to do them in. That way you don’t pause while writing down tasks. \~ **(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)**
* Don’t be afraid to stimulate yourself if you need it. Listen to a podcast or music to get yourself to do something. \~ **(**u/fineandnormal**)**
* Reward yourself when you get things done. Positive Reinforcement is good and you’ll feel like getting more things done. \~ **(**u/prince-ali-but-short**)**
* Change your environment and work from a place where there are fewer distractions. e.g: Cafe/library. You’ll get more stuff done \~ **(**u/humbled_lightbringer**)**
* Set a time to do work, and a time to relax; that way you don’t feel guilty about relaxing during the time you set aside for yourself. \~ **(**u/talking_face**)**
* Change your alarm sounds/timer sounds frequently, but use alarms and timers as much as possible. \~ **(**u/Little_Blue_Shed**)**
* Treat timers and alarms like non-negotiable laws. When the timer goes off, doesn’t matter what you were doing seconds ago, it’s time to go. Half showered, wet hair, one eye done, whatever it is, you’re out the door. \~ **(Unknown)**

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Body doubling - if you need to do some work that requires focus without much fun, have someone in the room with you. They could be working too, or not. Just having them there makes everything just a little more interesting and a little more accountable. \~ **(**u/Creebjeez**)**  
>  
>*I feel like a lot of people are missing some sort of accountability system in their lives. I don’t do body doubling but I use Beeminder to keep me accountable.*

# Emotional Dysregulation

* Brain dump in a notebook by your bed every night. \~ **(**u/ALyscupcakes**)**
* Don’t feel bad about sucking at school/work. You’ll get better as you learn more strategies for coping with ADHD. Things get better \~ **(**u/astrozork321**)**
* Use writing/journaling as cognitive therapy to defuse emotional history \~ **(**u/Tman1307**)**
* Remind yourself that the world won’t end if a few things fall behind. \~ **(**u/theweirdo_nextdoor**)**
* Write a reverse todo-list. Write down the things you have accomplished for the day. That way you won’t feel overwhelmed and it’ll make you feel better. \~ **(**u/SuspiciousEchidna**)**
* You’re allowed to let things go. Forget irrelevant things and forgive yourself. Ignore the awkward thing you did last week. Life will move on. \~ **(**u/bitetheboxer**,** u/optimisticaspie)
* Forgive yourself for your limits. \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* Meditation. Active breaks for people that struggle to take breaks. Use a meditation app when you’re starting. Like Headspace \~ **(**u/Juan_Creamsicle**)**
* Start working on letting go of shame. It depresses your motivation and only makes things worse. You wouldn’t shame someone in a wheelchair for not getting things done, your difficulty is in your brain instead of your legs but it’s no less real. \~ **(**u/percyjeandavenger**)**
* Cognitive Behavioural Therapy + meditation **\~ (**u/beatadhd**)**

>**🌟 My Favourite:** You’re allowed to let things go. Forget irrelevant things and forgive yourself. Ignore the awkward thing you did last week. Life will move on. \~ **(**u/bitetheboxer**,** u/optimisticaspie)  
>  
>*Stop hating yourself. Don’t look at the future. Don’t look at the past. Look at the present. I used to always hate myself for being so unproductive. I realised how pointless that was and I started to focus on improving myself in the* ***present.***

# Sleep

* Put your phone on the other side of the room and make your alarm super loud. Gets you out off bed and will make you turn it off so you don’t wake other people up. \~ **(**u/Valendr0s**)**
* If you’re having trouble getting out of bed then set a timer on your phone for 5 minutes and chuck it across the room. It’ll force you to get up and turn it off. \~ **(**u/PMDicksInTinyClothes**)**
* Buy 2 bright lamps and 2 timers. Set them up to turn on automatically 5-15min before you want your alarm to go off in the morning. The lights help your body know its daytime \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Change your thermostat so the temperature goes down an hour before bedtime and gets warmer 30 minutes before you wake up. The cooler temperatures get your body to sleep and the warmer temperatures help you wake up \~ **(**u/lexid22**)**
* Use a reminder app for starting your bedtime routine, not just your bedtime. (And have a bedtime routine) \~ **(**u/3GrilledJalapenos**)**
* Try setup meetings/commitments early in the morning. They'll force you to get out of bed \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Set two alarms when you get up in the morning. One to get out of bed and one for your medication. e.g: 5:30 AM wake up and take medication and then fall back to bed. By your 6AM alarm you’ll have waken up and your meds will have kicked in \~ **(**u/BizzarduousTask**)**  
>  
>*What a great lifehack.* *I’ve been doing this the past few days (except I don’t wake up at 6AM) - it works pretty well. Also I throw my phone on the other side of the room so it forces me to get out of bed.*

# Relationships

* It’s okay to be in a room with people and just let people breathe. You don’t need to fill the silence. \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**
* When having a conversation or learning something, repeat every word the person says in your head. It’ll help you not drift off as much. It also makes it so you’ll interrupt people less. \~ **(**u/TheNocturne**)**
* Try to avoid the word 'but' when faced with a conflict. Instead try be constructive towards arguments/discussions with the word 'and'. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** For maintaining eye contact: Imagine a red dot on someone’s nose for intense focus. Bridge of the nose for paying attention. \~ **(**u/asmugone**)**  
>  
>*Haven’t tried this one but I used to have trouble with eye contact a few years ago so this stood out to me. I’m pretty good with eye contact now, but I’ll be trying it over the next few weeks anyway.*

# Work

* If you hate your job. Make a job switch. It’ll help you make positive changes in your life. \~ **(**u/Mooberry_**)**
* Find a job that works WITH your system. If you can’t wake up and be functional in the morning then stop trying. Find a job that doesn’t need you to wake up in the morning. Stop beating yourself up over things your brains isn’t designed for \~ **(**u/obxunseeker**)**
* Be self-employed and start a business. “No matter where I worked or what I did, I was constantly watching the clock, hating every single second of it. On Saturday I worked 27 straight hours to finish a job on time and it was still less painful than working an 8 hour shift as an employee. Those 27 hours disappeared and left me feeling gratified because I made someone’s house beautiful and I got to see how happy I made her the first time she saw her new home.” \~ (u/jake7697**)**
* When promising a timescale to a client, double or triple the amount of time that you initially think it will take. That way worst case scenario, you will finish it on deadline and meet expectations or best case, finish before and exceed expectations. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* The moment you know you aren’t going to make a deadline, let the client know and again give them an overestimate of time for new deadline. People are always understanding and appreciative for this quick communication. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* Reply to emails and messages when you read them. 99% of the time, days and weeks will go by if you tell yourself that you’ll reply later on… \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* Be honest about your limitations and own your shit. Most people have no idea how much adhd affects so many things and therefore can’t understand our inability to do basic things at times. Especially if you come across as smart and creative, they can misplace our struggles for laziness and lack of care. If you fuck up own it, explain why and apologise. It doesn’t have to be long winded but it is important to state how you aim to rectify the situation and again. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**
* Stop comparing your output and motivation to others and embrace a slower, more considered, creative one. You are not other people. You are you. Trying to jam your freeform, 12 sided shape into the round hole is painful and won’t work. You don’t need a hole, you need self acceptance. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Learn to say no to taking on things that you know may cause you stress and excess pressure just because it’s money. It is not worth it, just put the boundaries that will save your mental health in the first place and you won’t have to deal with the fallout later. The more you do it, the easier it becomes. \~ **(**u/Somewhereonabike**)**  
>  
>*God yes… ADHD people have a dangerous habit of overcommitting to stuff. Personally I think I just forget that I’m already working on X, Y and Z. Sustainability is important - don’t overcommit.*

# School

* Use Active Recall + Spaced Repetition to study for all your exams. I've seen countless people go from C's to straight A's after adopting them \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**
* If you're finding it difficult to start assignments early then ONLY read + annotate the assignment brief early and go take a break after that. Your subconscious should process the information and it'll be easier to start later on. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**
* It’s better to turn in an assignment that is 75% done. It’ll drag your grades down less than if you never turned it in \~ **(**u/bitetheboxer**)**
* Print out lectures and powerpoints in advance (ask the teacher for them). That way you won’t need to listen and write at the same time. You can annotate the printed versions instead. \~ **(**u/strngrsstpngstngrs**)**

&#x200B;

>**🌟 My Favourite:** Visit your school's inclusivity and disability team. They will hopefully have policies for helping people with ADHD \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**  
>  
>*This is something I never took advantage of while at University, but I probably should have. A few assignment extensions when my meds stopped working would have saved me from countless all nighters…*

# Executive Function

* Setup a morning routine + a reset routine. A reset routine is something you do when you're feeling super unfocused. Mine consists of meditation, exercise, journaling, playing music and making some tea. \~ **(**u/beatadhd**)**

1i6p8xc,ADHD High IQ Finally realized why I am always exhausted.,Dear_Chemical4826,9538,2025-01-21 10:20:33,907,"41m. ADHD Inattentive type with high IQ. I finally realized why I am always exhausted.

I manage to be a decently functioning adult.  I am divorced, but I am a good dad and have been dating a woman my kids like for 3+ years (I like her too!).  My house is typically  messy, but I do own a modest house. I struggle sometimes at work, but make above average the median wage and have had the same job for 7 years. I don't have a emergency fund, but I have good credit and contribute to a retirment fund pretty regularly. You get the idea. Things are clearly ok, but things could clearly be better in lots of ways.

But there is also this: I am almost always exhausted. Like bone tired level of exhaustion comes up most days. I first remember this coming up in college. Sometimes I'm also dizzy from exhaustion. Hydration and exercise help some, but not completely.

Here is what I realized.

My processing speed and working memory suck--not official terms, but the same testing during my diagnosis that showed high IQ also showed low processing speed and working memory. But high IQ can solve a lot of problems. So it seems like I've routed my daily tasks through my intellect rather than through the habit building that working memory and processing speed seem to allow. Like when I put laundry away, I have to actually think about how to put laundry away.  When I clean the house, I have to actively think about how to do it.  There are very few daily processes that genuinely just become habit--I have to really think about all of them to make them happen.

I was talking to my GF about this and she noted that it sounds exhausting. I literally broke down crying in a coffee shop out of the recognition. It is so exhausting.

11:00 am - She started the dishes after sleeping in, and decided to make some tea to help her get energized. It was a new type of tea so she brought the mug in to give me a taste. She sat down to sip it and a cat sat on her lap so she had to stay for a bit.

l4ybvt,"When you buy things, pay the ADHD tax upfront.",None,8821,2021-01-25 13:41:04,696,"I've seen a lot of posts about the ADHD tax-- the late fees, the groceries that go bad, lost items, impulse purchases we never touch... you get the picture.  It's real, and it sucks.

One thing I've noticed lately, though, is how sometimes, you can get away with paying a smaller ADHD tax if you plan ahead when you buy things.  Hear me out.

1. I could buy a whole crown of fresh broccoli for like, $1.50, but I won't get around to washing, cutting, and preparing it.  A $2.50 bag of pre-cut, pre-washed broccoli will get eaten.  Instead of a $1.50 ADHD tax for broccoli I won't eat, it's a $1.00 tax for broccoli I will eat.
2. A cute planner or notebook with a great layout is worth $30 if I will actually use it.  An awkward-to-use planner that I'm not motivated to ever touch is useless, and not worth spending even $5 on.
3. With vitamins, if they're not gummies, I won't maintain the habit of taking them.  I'll pay extra for the gummy vites that I will use versus the regular ones I will waste.

Other things include: paying for Spotify Premium because I know that ads (or going to find music elsewhere) will distract me.  Only buying clothes from stores with really long return windows, even if it's pricier (REI lets you return things for a full year, bro).  Paying more for a phone with a really long battery life so it's not dead half the time.

 As someone who was raised to be frugal, a lot of this stuff feels kinda shameful almost?  But when I stop and think about it, I stand by my assessment that it's actually cheaper this way.

Edit: thank you!  but please don't spend money on awards.  spend it on pre-washed, fresh cut broccoli, pals

Edit 2: Y'all make some great points.  The encouragement and understanding in the comments is making my whole week.

After some further reflection, some things really stand out to me:

1.  Viewing willpower and energy as limited resources is critical.  Purchases are cost + willpower + energy.  Whole, unwashed broccoli is lower on cost but higher on willpower and energy demands.  

-> I feel like we can punish ourselves for wasting time.  Like I convinced myself ""don't buy pre-prepped veggies if you're gonna waste 8 hrs on video games, you can spare the time.""  But that's basically punishing myself for having ADHD by depriving myself of vegetables I'd actually eat. 
 
-> Besides, maybe the 20 mins I save by having pre-prepped broccoli means I have enough mental energy to wash some dishes after I eat, which means washing dishes on Saturday takes 40 minutes instead of an hour, which means I have enough energy to clean my room, and so on.  

2.  Frozen vegetables & fruit, meal kits, and bulk purchases help.  I will also add: did you know you can freeze bread??  Then toast it and it's good!

3.  Point of caution: spending more on something doesn't necessarily mean it's more likely to be used.  We have all been there.  But if something will genuinely be more usable or more functional at a higher cost, it might be really worth it.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/l4ybvt/when_you_buy_things_pay_the_adhd_tax_upfront/,True,False

I don’t even have a “preferred” internet browser, and have years of unorganized and outdated bookmarks. Who knows why I choose to screenshot info vs. saving/bookmarking. 

My laptop desktop/downloads/documents is a mess of programs, photos, and files. Every so often I take everything and put it in a
one folder just to avoid thinking about it. Tax information might be the only folder that isn’t a disaster. 

Sadly, it’s all information I once found important and worth reviewing. But unless if I definitely needed to return to that info again in the near future, I never have!

I also got a bachelor's degree while undiagnosed. I want to share my top ADHD tips from all this. I'm calling them the three ""virtues"" (nod to Larry Wall).

1. **Loitering.** I've also seen it called ""junebugging."" You need to clean the kitchen but you can't get started? Cool, then don't. Just go stand around by the stove/sink, maybe putter around the area aimlessly for a while. Put on some music if you want. If you happen to pick something up and put it in its spot, great. No explicit goals, no method, you're doing what you feel and if the kitchen is 10% cleaner when you're done, that's a whole lot better than nothing.
2. **Defiance.** Doing a task or assignment by the book is like pulling your own teeth. Instead, leverage your dark side and come up with a way to get it done while pissing someone off. I lost more than a few points in college for being too flippant in my essays or choosing far-fetched theses. But I graduated with a 3.9 GPA, so it worked out. You can be ""defiant"" in other ways, too—overachieving, inventiveness, breaking from tradition, really anything that shatters expectations or deviates from the norm can be interesting enough to engage your brain.
3. **Vanity.** The only thing more motivating than surprise is admiration. I may not be good at doing dishes and studying for exams in real life, but if someone comes over I can be a *model citizen* for like two hours. I will literally do the dishes in front of you, casually, just so you think I'm a good person who does the dishes. And I will lead a jam-packed study session with five classmates just so they can see how scholarly I am. I don't know why ""body doubling"" works for y'all but this is why it works for me.

Medication and therapy have been godsends as well, of course. There are still days when I can't get off the damn couch, but overall I'm in a good place.

Good luck to all of you, hope this helps.

uu7el5,The only “adhd hack” that’s actually helped me,borrowedurmumsvcard,6599,2022-05-20 13:50:35,858,"If someone is in a wheelchair, and they encounters stairs, they aren’t just gonna try their best to get down the stairs, they’re going to use the ramp or elevator. why should we keep trying to do things that other people do, when we are not like other people?(without adhd)

I have a mental illness, or learning disability, or disorder, whatever you wanna call it, and I am not able to do everything as easily as other people can. So why should I be trying to do exactly the same stuff? I can’t! 

okay I can set a reminder for myself to vacuum the house later but the problem isn’t always that I forget, the problem is the vacuuming. I can set so much time aside to do the dishes but the problem isn’t the time, it’s doing the dishes. so why do we still try to do everything that other people do when we have a diagnosed issue? Well, stop! 

if you struggle with bringing the vacuum all the way from the closet to the living room to vacuum, stop! Keep the vacuum in the living room, better yet, keep it plugged in if you’re able

if you struggle with doing dishes, absolutely nothing is stopping you from just using paper plates

if you struggle with bringing trash to the kitchen, just keep a giant trash can in every room  

if you struggle with putting clothes away after washing them, just don’t fucking put them away!! fold them straight out of the dryer and just keep all your clothes in baskets

if you physically cannot focus on homework while you’re at home, instead of trying to force yourself to focus, just go to a coffee shop or library if you can. even sitting in a different room can help

if the crusty toothpaste bottle grosses you out and that deters you from brushing, look up how to make little single use toothpaste pellets 

if you struggle with bringing a charger everywhere and your phone is always dead, just put chargers everywhere! I have one in my bedroom, car, living room, and bathroom

If you struggle with cooking or preparing food, just get pre prepared food! it took me a long time and a lot of rotten fruit before I finally started buying precut fruit and guess what? haven’t wasted any since. it feels like it’s more expensive but just think about all the food you’ve wasted because it wasn’t prepared and you couldn’t bring yourself to cook it      

if you have the luxury of being able to afford a housekeeper, or a roomba, or a weekly mealkit service use them!! I know it makes you feel guilty but that’s what those services are for!!! they’re there so you can use them! never feel guilty about taking advantage of a system that’s designed to help you! (easier said than done I know)

do you get it?

stop feeling bad about having to be different to cater to your disorder. YOU HAVE A DISORDER! YOU’RE ALLOWED TO BREAK “RULES.” if you had a physical disorder would you feel bad? hmm? if you were in a wheelchair would you feel bad every time you used the elevator? just because our disorder is not as apparent doesn’t mean you have to struggle in silence. these tips aren’t going to fix everything, but they will definitely make your life a little easier

Back in 2020 i had a mental breakdown that landed me in a partial program for 4 months. I was released when i was given to my therapist (they didn't want me to be discharged without having a therapist). We'll call her P.

P was an intern, which kind of in a way upset me because i had requested someone who specializes in trauma as i have PTSD and ADHD.

Our first session went okay, the words out of her mouth were ""Yeah so i don't believe in EVERYTHING when it comes to mental health care"" (ok but why are you doing this then lmao). We were getting to know each other as you would in the first session. At one point she had made a comment that ""oh my god thats such an aries thing!"" (Im not against people who believe in astrology, but now i don't trust people who do)

Our second session was where i was completely sideswiped. I was telling her that i have a really hard time starting projects and when i do, I can't finish them. Almost in tears as im saying it because i hate that I can't finish things. She goes ""It could be mental illness, or it could totally be an aries thing!""

I have a real hard time advocating for myself, but i wasn't about to have someone tell me my issues/things i suffer with are because of when i was born. I felt so invalidated after that second session that i cried on the way home. 

3 days later i manage to muster up the courage to call and ask for a supervisor. Ya'll she was so shocked she was speechless. Needles to say i was immediately placed on another wait list to be seen by someone else. Who i currently now see and she is wonderful.

But thats the story of my zodiac therapist, and i will never not joke about it. I'll be moody and start laughing and go ""oh its because im an aries!"" 🤣

Don't be afraid to speak up friends!

Edit: I didn't expect to wake up for my 4am shift with so many comments and validation, let alone awards. Thank you all so much! Self advocating is super hard, but i always remind people that its sometimes something we unfortunately have to do. Holding people accountable is hard.

prnfcm,"I hired a nanny for myself because ADHD is a disability and I deserve help. You do, too.",milobdenum,6308,2021-09-19 21:15:44,830,"(Paragraphs are titled because everyone reading this has ADHD lol)

## Me personally:

I'm 28, I have a career, I build furniture for fun, and I somehow can't [insert every basic household chore here]. I desperately want to, but those kind of foundation-level tasks just make my brain explode, hello ADHD. So you know what I did? It was nowhere near easy, but I hired a nanny. For myself. Just this past month. And it's fucking amazing.

The more I learned about my ADHD, the more I've come to terms with the fact that I _am not lazy,_ I have a goddamn mental disorder! This is a DISABILITY so why the hell are we all pretending it's our fault??

## Validating my choice, societal scale:

I did some hard thinking on ~society~ and realized that the whole reason humans thrive is because we chip in with the things we're good at and get help from others who have the skills we lack. That's why there's the sales department and the engineering department, no one would expect those people to be interchangeable. You've got the baker and the blacksmith, both relying on each other and no one bats an eye at that. (In the US at least) we have this poisonous and completely false emphasis on individuality and independence that just a flat out lie. Nobody actually lives like that.

## ...and then personal scale:

So bringing it back: I'm not bad at doing chores, per se, but it takes me an absurd amount of energy to do what others can do easily, so I thought, why am I killing myself like this? I know my problems stem from ADHD which I can only control so much, and I've tried everything I could possibly think of to make it easier, so why am I counting this as a failure? Why should I even NEED to be fully independent on these things when someone else could and would help me? 

## So I did it!!!

I had to wrangle my ingrained humiliation, but I went online and hired someone with the understanding that I have insurmountable problems (don't downplay yourself, it's just the truth) and need assistance to thrive (as all humans do with all sorts of different things). 

If you can afford $30/week to have somebody nice to come over twice a week for an hour and help you catch up on chores, I can tell you it is absolutely life changing. Simply having that safety net has even made me able to handle some of the things I previously couldn't, all on my own!! My depression is even on vacation! 

# HOW I did it (in detail — bolded important parts)

I tried several methods that didn't pan out, until **my therapist recommended care.com.** It has a fee but it was worth it, because they have such a wide user base and the people are legitimately good. 

There is basically no acknowledgment (in general) that adults with ADHD even deserve this kind of help (and therefore no category for it) so I chose the closest and **I put an ad in the Nanny category, and this was effective!** (Elderly Care was runner-up) This worked because most people interested in being a nanny just genuinely want to help make someone's life easier. Some people also just really love kids, so I read people's bios to judge who would be sympathetic and would really enjoy helping me. 

**I was super clear in my ad that I'm an adult and I need help looking after my home life** and details of precisely what kind of help I was looking for so there were no misunderstandings. ([Here's what I wrote](https://imgur.com/a/z9617bf)) I felt super vulnerable and scared and I actually asked a close friend if they would help me answer messages, but I ended up being able to do it on my own. After a few days I got a lot of hits and also reached out to people who had the magic combo of Nanny, Housekeeping, and Special Needs as their fields.

**People were unbelievably nice!** One girl even messaged me to say that she did not have any availability but she was proud of me and wished me the best and I'm crying right now LMAO

**Anyway it worked!!!!!** This awesome lady comes over to my apartment twice a week now (she's a mom and has two autistic sons, so she GETS IT). She just helps me do all my chores and anything that I've been having a hard time with. 

## What she does for me:

She comes twice a week: 

1. First, she does my dishes because that is the hardest thing for me. She just walks in, over to the sink, and immediately grabs the sponge <3

2. I make a list of what I have been putting off for the past few days, and we work together!

3. She does the things that are giving me the most stress, and I do whatever I feel comfortable with. (She has assured me that she wouldn't mind doing everything, but I want to help and her presence unlocks my paralysis.)

4. She's super nice and straightforward and we enjoy each other's company, which is a plus!


Anyway, I'm sharing this journey because every single person with ADHD deserves someone to help them. ADHD is a disability and that isn't shameful. I know how hard it is to find help when everyone tells you you shouldn't need it, so I hope this can help somebody!

💖

_Edit: I've added a pic of [the job posting I wrote](https://imgur.com/a/z9617bf)_

_Edit 2: Regarding price! Many people have pointed out that $30/week seems super low._ This is because the person I've hired is **not** working for me as a nanny or a housekeeper. The workload is much lighter than a nanny, and the focus of the work is very different than a housekeeper. Housekeepers help the home, but the person I hired helps _me_ help the home.

She also doesn't rely on this for income. I've found that there are a lot of people out there in the same position. For instance, I've found that some are stay-at-home moms who legitimately like this stuff and just want to help somebody and get out of the house for a couple hours a week. (Also, I told her to name her price and she asked for less than I ended up giving her, so 🤷)

For reference, my average regional prices:

- Housekeeper — $120/visit
- Nanny — $25-35/hr
- Minimum wage — $9.70/hr",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/prnfcm/i_hired_a_nanny_for_myself_because_adhd_is_a/,True,False
qxftw8,I scared my boyfriend yesterday after I took my first dose of Adderall,coloncancer_sucks,6280,2021-11-19 05:06:39,738,"I got to take my first dose of Adderall (20 mg) yesterday evening. (I'm prescribed to take 2-20mg pills a day, but had to work during the day before I picked up my prescription.)

After about an hour after taking the pill, I got a blast of energy and then it eventually turned into  happiness and calmness. 

As soon as I felt relaxed -A feeling I've never felt before- I instantly started sobbing. My boyfriend looks over at me and saw me bawling my eyes out.  

In the middle of his game, he told his friends he had to go and started asking me what was wrong. He was scared that something bad happened. The exchange went something like this:

Him: Babe, what's wrong? 
Me: I'm happy.
Him: What?
Me: I'm so happy.
Him: Awww! As long as it's happy tears! 

He hugged me and I felt free.

I know that the exact feeling will eventually level out, but it was amazing and beautiful.

Edit:


thank you so much for the support and the awards. i never expected to get this much attention from my post!!!

hi, i appreciate all of the concern about my starting dosage. my doctor is the number one diagnostician in their state and easily read me like a book. all of the reviews rave about how their lives were changed. i fully trust my doctor. 

 I have ptsd, ocd, anxiety, depression, and pmdd on top of my adhd. it was really hard to function everyday and i just need pep in my step, which is why my dosage is higher than what people are used to. 

I also just started taking 25mg of zoloft this past monday, prescribed from a nurse practitioner on lemonaid health. my doctor immediately said that the dosage needs to be changed  to 50mg when i have my follow up on lemonaid health. of course i can't feel the difference yet since it takes a few weeks to start working/ seeing the affects. 

I know i'm in the honeymoon period, and wrote that i knew this feeling would level out. i'm not trying to mislead anyone!

I don't love getting messaged about how all i need to do is do deep breathing exercises to control my adhd. i grew up very active in a church where they didn't believe in mental health issues and adhd was ""a made up illness to control 6 year old boys that just needed the belt."" i tried to cope for 29 years without professional help. deep breathing exercises don't cure adhd.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/qxftw8/i_scared_my_boyfriend_yesterday_after_i_took_my/,True,False

I work a regular 9-5 job that is fine for me. I like it, it keeps me busy. But I don't know how to get myself going at night to do anything but game.

I can get myself to do something that I absolutely need to do because it has to be done be tomorrow, but I can't get usual stuff done like dishes, laundry, clean the bathroom, etc. pretty much the only thing I can muster the energy to do is to play video games or Sudoku and watch TV.

I take Vyvanse, which helps me focus at work. But I'm really struggling to do anything else. On weekends, I'm struggling to get going on house work and give up easily. I've tried lists, rewards, calendars, reminders, alarms. My ability to ignore any of those and play something instead is STRONG.

Every autism subreddit I have seen is rife with toxic positivity. It's impossible to mention even the slightest struggle related to my own experience with autism. 

For some reason, people on these subreddits take another person's opinion on their OWN life very personally. If I post that I am frustrated at feeling distanced from other people and wishing I had better social skills, I will get 1 comment that is supportive and the rest are all people who feel that I have posted simply to spite them and insult their existence.

They will say ""You have a negative attitude about autism and your internalized ableism is  unhealthy. I am autistic and I love every second of it, watch some inspirational youtube videos about autistic savants and cheer the fuck up.""

One of the top posts in the aspergers subreddit is concerning this exact topic, and even there the comments are locked due to toxicity. I understand and respect that some see autism as their personality and that it is a ""superpower"" or a benign difference. But to me, it is not. It is a label that I have, like ""right-handed."" I guess you can say that is a part of who I am but it is not even close to all of me. And again, for me, autism is anything but a positive and it certainly not benign. 

Here, in this subreddit I feel free and supported to discuss my struggles which often overlap with my autism. I also have to praise this subreddit's rejection of neurodiversity. In autism subs it is common to see posts insulting non-autistic people and some even see being autistic people as being superior to non-autistic people. That kind of stuff is why I try not to bother with those subs anymore.

qwdzqh,What I thought ADHD was vs. what it's actually like for me,clearlystyle,5778,2021-11-17 17:13:51,959,"People think ADHD looks like:

- Not paying attention in class

- Daydreaming

- Having too much energy

- Causing trouble

- Getting bad grades

- Procrastinating


But for me, it actually looks like:

- Talking too much/too quickly/too loudly

- Interrupting people

- Glazing over when others are speaking

- Unconsciously repeating weird sounds I hear (echolalia)

- Rattling off factual information that may or may not be of interest to others (infodumping)

- Losing my train of thought

- Doomscrolling

- Not being able to get motivated to start new tasks, even ones I am excited about (executive dysfunction)

- Finding monotony and tedium completely unbearable

- Fidgeting

- Only getting halfway through what I am doing before moving on to something else

- Terrible short-term memory

- Relying heavily on lists and spreadsheets to get anything done

- Being engrossed for hours/days/weeks when I find something interesting (hyperfocus)

- Constantly trying and abandoning new hobbies

- Always having songs stuck in my head

- Perpetually underestimating how long things will take

- Staying up past midnight and struggling to get out of bed in the morning (Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome)

- Missing appointments

- Running late

- Forgetting why I walked into a room (The Threshold Effect)

- Losing important items

- An online shopping addiction

- Caring way too much about what other people think of me (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria)

- Drinking tons of caffeine

- Binge eating sugar

- Accidentally skipping meals because I don't realize I'm hungry

- Letting my food get cold because I forget that I am eating it, which I am literally doing at this exact moment

Edit to add one I left in the comments that a LOT of people in the particularly identified with:

- Writing and speaking in extremely long sentences with exceedingly complex sentence structure, generously peppered with () ; : and -- marks for flavor. If this is something you struggle with as well, the primary words I scan my text for are ""and,"" ""but,"" ""so,"" ""which,"" and ""thus."" When these words appear after a comma, they are frequently a good spot to swap out the comma for a period.


Also, while I'm editing this novel anyway, I have one more tip to add that can help others take you more seriously. Since you're already rereading what you wrote anyway, you might as well scan for this, too. I recommend reconsidering the word ""just"" in your sentences, particularly if you identify as a woman. ""Just"" is most frequently used to diminish the intensity of what you're saying. ""I was just wondering..."" ""I just thought..."" ""I just meant..."" It's insidiously deferential. (It's also subtly encouraged by a patriarchal society that genuinely feels that women are worth less than men and should be submissive to them.) If you change the above statements by removing the ""just,"" they immediately become more assertive: ""I was wondering..."" ""I thought..."" ""I meant..."" It doesn't substantially alter your meaning, but it significantly modifies your tone and immediately makes you appear more confident and worth taking seriously, which is how you low-key earn people's respect.

Obviously, there are still many other situations where the ""just"" is critical to the meaning of your statement. This is particularly true of ""just"" when referring to time, rather than personal actions. If I changed ""he just left"" to ""he left,"" it loses a significant portion of its meaning. Like I said, RECONSIDER ""just,"" not ""remove it from your vocabulary,"" because sometimes it's necessary. When you're editing your writing, think about each one and whether it's necessary. If not, leave it out.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/qwdzqh/what_i_thought_adhd_was_vs_what_its_actually_like/,True,False

ADHD falls under the guidelines for a disability, and as such you may qualify for this offer. You can get your pass online for a $10 processing fee, or for free at any National Parks ticket booth. You will need to provide proof of your disability, so either medical records, or a doctor’s note. 

I’ve heard anecdotal stories that sometimes you can just sign an affidavit at a ticket booth, or show your meds, too. I recently applied online and had my pass mailed within 2 weeks.

This is such a great opportunity to make use of. Personally, being in nature is the only time I’m mostly free of my symptoms, and I plan to basically live in National Parks this summer!

xj72q9,Y'all NEED to hear this... ADHDers use strong negative emotions to motivate ourselves...,Longjumping-Ad6526,5699,2022-09-20 05:09:55,684,"So I was reading this book... ""Your Brain's Not Broken"" by Tamara Rosier and it explains the most fucked up shit about how ADHDers motive themselves using intense emotions since we can't motivate like NTs. As you know, we are motivated by interest rather than importance and consequences... so how do we get the day to day shit done in order to function? Here we go.

**Anxiety:** We rely on anxiety to tell us what needs to be done. ""Did I lock my car? What happened if I accidentally unlocked it? My stuff would get stolen! I can't buy a new one. Lock car, lock car, lock car!"" It is like we inject strong emotions like fight or flight into ourselves but the thing is they can linger AFTER. ""Oh, wait I just locked the car right? Yeah, Oh I'm worried oh gosh!"" Yeah, that is mentally taxing.

**Anger:** Getting mad in order to fuel ourselves to do the task. The book gives an example of this guy whos mother was angered by his behavior and ""when no one else was around to yell at me, I learned to yell at myself."" As you can imagine this is not healthy and it leads to exhaustion and crankiness.

**Shame/ Self-loathing:** An intense feeling of being flawed of unworthy of love. ""To start, I imagine how disappointed my supervisor would be if I don't finish on time. She will realize she shouldn't have given me the job in the first place""... ""I have to get this right or I'll screw up my kids for the rest of their life"".. so we are rehearsing different ways we are damaged, incompetent and stupid.

pntlfz,I read a meme about how people will take you seriously if you say that you have a neurological condition that (symptom) but as soon as you mention it’s ADHD their demeanor changes. It’s true. You could literally be like…,kittykat-kay,5629,2021-09-13 19:05:35,605,"*inhale*

“I have a neurodevelopmental condition that affects my brains ability to do executive functioning, which basically means that things like planning, organization, impulse control, task initiation, short-term memory, sustained focus, self-motivation and time management are more difficult for me which can affect my daily life, which requires these skills. My prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for a lot of this and higher functions is likely smaller than average and would likely show less activity on a brain scan. People with this disorder typically have brains that are 3 years behind in development in relation to their peers in certain aspects. 

 A big component to this disorder is dysregulation of the central nervous system and has even been found to be frequently comorbid with other disorders such as sleep disorders which can compound on this. Though we don’t know exactly what is going on in every case I likely have lower-than-normal levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine, responsible for many many functions, including the ones affected by this condition. Possibly serotonin and/or norepinephrine as well.

 A large impairment is inability to REGULATE ones focus. It’s not so much about complete lack per say that someone with this can focus sometimes but has difficulty choosing when or for what. They may try to start a task only to quickly get distracted on something else completely irrelevant, and may end up focusing on that instead. I can focus for a long time sometimes on something that is interesting but not so important, but when I need to sit down and do something unstimulating, say, paperwork, a combination of poor impulse control, racing thoughts, low frustration tolerance and high distractability means that I might struggle more significantly than the average person who might not like doing it, but can just buckle down and “get er’ done” when needed. Sometimes it is the opposite, where I focus too much to the point of not being able to stop/redirect it, despite it being more convenient to do so. Some may also hop from task to task as they have new thoughts to distract them on to something else, forgetting what they were originally doing. This is no more controllable than a person with OCD controls their compulsions, although there are strategies to help cope and work around ones deficits in order to succeed. 

Not exclusive but common to this disorder is dysregulation of emotions as well. This is not as well known, but when I am angry, I RAGE, when I am sad, my entire world crashes down around me. When I am happy, I am EXCITED and BURSTING WITH ENERGY. The emotional roller coaster in itself is exhausting, and for those that especially struggle with the poor impulse control aspect, it can get them in trouble. 

Speaking of that, it is estimated that nearly a quarter of the prison population has this disorder, despite it only effecting about 4% of the general population. That’s a huge difference. That’s not to say that having this MAKES one a criminal: we all choose our path in life. But some of the traits associated with it: impulsivity and hyperactivity, increased risk-taking  (mixed in with the wrong environment and bad influences/choices) can certainly make things worse, and predispose the wrong (or right I guess) person to that kind of lifestyle. 

Having this disorder also can predispose you to having substance use or abuse issues. People with this are hugely overrepresented among addicts, with this disorder being 5 to 10 times more prevalent amongst alcoholics than the general population. Poor impulse control and higher risk-taking/novelty-seeking behaviour, can contribute, as well “self-medication” to try to deal with the symptoms of this disorder. Many claim that their drink or puff or what-have-you will “slow them down” enough to be able to focus, although clearly this maladaptive coping strategy comes with many consequences, and the actual vs. perceived benefit seems… questionable. Also common is binge eating, smoking, excessive caffeine intake (caffeine and nicotine are stimulants, albeit mild ones that have shown some benefit for treating the symptoms of this disorder) and impulse shopping/difficulty with managing finances. 

People with this disorder are nearly twice to three times as likely to get into a vehicle accident than people without. 

This disorder is highly comorbid or a common cause of secondary anxiety and/or depression. Struggling with this untreated can make the person depressed because they feel that no matter how hard they try, they are still having more difficulty than the people around them, and may not be doing as well at school or work as they want to, which causes a huge blow to the self-esteem. They may blurt things out in conversations or have struggles socializing, (though not nearly to the degree or in the same ways as autism) sometimes seeming “weird” to others, which can lead to judgement and social rejection, hurting their self-esteem and confidence further. They may begin to see themselves as stupid, lazy, or crazy. Children growing up with this condition are estimated to receive about 20,000 more negative messages from others, due to the symptoms they display which may be misunderstood by others, by age 10. Many adults with the disorder report feeling like they are dissatisfied and lost in life and unable to utilize their full potential. Once the main cause (the primary disorder) is treated, the “depression” tends to go away. It can also cause anxiety due to constant worrying of what they might forget next, due to the short term memory issues, or how they might mess up, especially if they have been heavily criticized in the past for their symptoms, which can be seen as “laziness” or “lack of discipline” by the general population. Many report having what could be described as a whirlwind of racing thoughts that never seem to stop and make it incredibly hard to concentrate. Anxiety can also be used as a (poor, if I do say so myself) coping mechanism, as the rush of adrenaline and cortisol associated with (say) being about to miss a deadline may be able to temporarily compensate for the lack of dopamine that is thought to impede their ability to focus. Basically sending them into fight or flight just so they panic and complete the task. This is how some people with the disorder learn to function: by being stressed all the time, or even OVERLY organized and neurotic in an OCD-like way in order to overcompensate and try to stay on top of their symptoms and calm the mess in their head. (Though certainly a lot don’t or would struggle too much to even develop this way of coping in particular) 

Wait! But there’s good news. There’s a treatment that’s been studied for a long time, proven relatively safe for MOST healthy people at prescribed therapeutic dosages, has actually been proven to calm hyperactivity and/or racing thoughts, LOWER rates of addiction and substance misuse amongst the treated despite being a pill and is usually not addicting to those who actually need it and take it as directed, (the problem is remembering to take it lol) lowers the risk of driving accidents to about normal, increases dopamine levels and activity in the prefrontal cortex, allowing people with the disorder to function much more normally, decreases impulsivity and may even help with emotional regulation for some people. Can even calm anxiety IF the anxiety was stemming from their untreated disorder symptoms, despite being typically contraindicated for anxiety disorders.”

jbpfhp,“Here’s something that happens to ADHD children a lot: Getting pushed beyond their limits by accident. Here’s how it works and why it’s so bad.” (From a Tumblr post linked below.),splenicartery,5499,2020-10-15 08:14:13,564,"Child says, “I can’t do this.”
Adult (teacher or parent) does not believe it, because Adult has seen Child do things that Adult considers more difficult, and Child is too young to properly articulate why the task is difficult.

Adult decides that the problem is something other than true inability, like laziness, lack of self-confidence, stubbornness, or lack of motivation.

Adult applies motivation in the form of harsher and harsher scoldings and punishments. Child becomes horribly distressed by these punishments. Finally, the negative emotions produce a wave of adrenaline that temporarily repairs the neurotransmitter deficits caused by ADHD, and Child manages to do the task, nearly dropping from relief when it’s finally done.

The lesson Adult takes away is that Child was able to do it all along, the task was quite reasonable, and Child just wasn’t trying hard enough. 

Now, surely Child has mastered the task and learned the value of simply following instructions the first time.

The lessons Child takes away? Well, it varies, but it might be:

-How to do the task while in a state of extreme panic, which does NOT easily translate into doing the task when calm.

-Using emergency fight-or-flight overdrive to deal with normal daily problems is reasonable and even expected.

-It’s not acceptable to refuse tasks, no matter how difficult or potentially harmful.

-Asking for help does not result in getting useful help.

EDIT: I totally didn’t expect this to resonate with so many people! We aren’t alone, y’all. I love this community. This is how we heal.💕

EDIT 2: someone pointed out this clarification, that it’s not a wave of Adrenalin but a wave of serotonin:

“The adrenaline release is a physiological response to stress and is responsible for the heightened emotions and arousal, but serotonin mediates the behavioral response. Once that response is initiated, the heightened adrenaline will cause stronger memory consolidation, causing the child to learn to do that task only when subjected to an intense stress response, as well as causing avoidant behavior toward that task at all. The rest is on point though.”",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/jbpfhp/heres_something_that_happens_to_adhd_children_a/,True,False

lud5qo,Years of living with ADHD was training for this moment!,wearekindtosnails,5465,2021-02-28 02:55:41,290,"My wife lost her VERY expensive retainer last night. She left it on the kitchen bench among a pile of toys, rubbish, groceries, and other junk. This morning, it was still missing.

She never loses anything and had no idea what to do.

Luckily, I have lost wallets, phones, keys, medications, books and anything else you can imagine. I'd been preparing my whole life for this moment.

""Right, don't put any rubbish in the bin outside or take anything out of the house.""

""It isn't in the rubbish bin...""

""Doesn't matter. A few hours from now, you're going to start to doubt yourself. If we contain the spaces it could be NOW, we won't have to worry later.""

She checked the bin and it wasn't there. So we started searching.

After we'd searched all the places a normie would look, we went deep dive. Under the fridge, in pot plants, under the bed, between books, in the fridge, in drawers we haven't opened in weeks, in rooms we hadn't been in.

Every time she protested that I was being illogical I said ""It doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense. We can't trust your memory. Remember when my iphone was on the roof of the car for two days? It could be anywhere.""

Tonight, she went to take out the bin after checking most of it again.

""What are you doing?""

""Putting out the rubbish. I know it isn't in there.""

""Check again.""

She took out 80% of the rubbish again.

""It can't be at the very bottom, that's from days ago.

""Doesn't matter.""

And there it was!

A lifetime of doubting myself paid off!

TL;DR - My knack for losing things helped my wife find her retainer.

113bd4c,"Subscriptions you can't cancel over the phone or online should be illegal, and they feel specifically designed to prey on ADHD/Disabled people",SploogeMcDucc,5444,2023-02-15 15:07:19,473," 

For me, personally, this has cost me hundreds of dollars. Let me give you an example: a few years ago, I joined Planet Fitness. I liked the gym, but after a few months, I decided that I didn't want to go anymore. I went online to cancel my membership, but I couldn't find any way to do it on their website. I called their customer service line, but they told me that the only way to cancel was to send a letter to your home gym or go in person. Well, I moved hundreds of miles away... great

Now, for most people, this might not be a big deal. But for me, someone who struggles with executive function and memory issues, this was a huge obstacle. I kept forgetting to write the letter and send it out, and as a result, I ended up paying for the membership for over a year until I just now remembered to go cancel it.

This might not seem like a big deal, but it adds up. I ended up spending hundreds of dollars on a membership I wasn't using because I couldn't remember to cancel it.

I think it's important to acknowledge that this kind of practice is specifically designed to prey on people who struggle with executive function and memory issues. For people like me, who have ADHD or other mental conditions, for a lot of people the idea of having to send a letter or go to a physical location to cancel a subscription can be overwhelming and daunting.

In the age of the internet, there's no fucking reason why companies shouldn't offer online or phone cancellation options.

It's time for us to start holding companies accountable for this kind of unethical behavior. We need to demand that they make their cancellation policies more accessible and user-friendly. And we need to start talking about how these policies disproportionately affect disabled people.

We deserve better than this. We deserve to have cancellation policies designed with all customers in mind, not just those who can easily navigate complicated processes. I wish we could sue those fuckers with a class action but I assume the contracts are pretty legally sound and we can't just play the disability card.

Ok this is a little ridicolous but hear me out. I noticed I use way more commas than what is considered normal in writing. And now I'm starting to think it's an ADHD-thing.

Why is this? I think there are two reasons: One, it's sort of the way many of us think and speak. A series of related thoughts or ideas, which somehow are all linked together.

Secondly, long sentences are hard to read because you need to keep the meaning of the entire sentence in the working memory, which is hard. Commas space them apart, and make them easier to handle and ""hold"" in the working memory of the brain.

Not to mention how difficult it is to get diagnosed, and to get a proper prescription once you get diagnosed, and to get your insurance to cover your prescription once you get one, and then to get the pharmacy to actually fill it. And the stigma that comes with taking it!

Finally you get up and go to make breakfast, but you don't really feel like eating breakfast. So you look in the fridge for a few minutes, can't decide what to make, and close the fridge.

You then get ready for the day, if youre a distance learner like me you'll fire up your laptop and do one of two things. You'll sit there blankly staring at the screen until your alarm goes off to join the class, or you browse idly through YouTube or discord. Once in class you both don't have the capacity to care and don't have the capacity to listen, so you continue to browse through social media blindly.

At the end of the day you sit there on the computer or your phone, searching for some sort of stimulation. Maybe you fire up a game to play, only to discover that you don't really care about it anymore and can't get the stimulation it used to give. So you go to bed, your mind racing and unable to stop thinking, and finally fall asleep at 2am waiting for that alarm in the morning.

ma499k,"My doctor is a god of ADHD treatment. He has ADHD himself, has numerous ADHD patients, and takes the exact same medication I do (generic adderall). Here are some of his tips that I've found very helpful",JeffTM,5095,2021-03-21 12:37:32,580,"As the title says my doctor is a god and I'm so lucky to have him. Here are some tips he's gave me that have been extremely helpful in my treatment.

* **Medication holidays**: Don't bother. He's been on Adderall for over 2 decades now and it still works at the right dose. He also says that taking med holidays can even set you up for anxiety and depression because of the withdrawal and recovery
* **Tolerance building**: There is a limit to how much tolerance you can build. It's OK to increase your dose if you need to. Eventually you will no longer need to increase it
* **Waking up in the morning**: If you struggle to wake up in the morning like many of us taking stimulant meds take your morning dose one hour before you actually have to wake up. Then, just go back to sleep for another hour (have 2 alarms).
    * I can personally confirm this makes mornings much easier. I can also confirm that I am perfectly capable of sleeping another 3 hours after taking my meds if I don't set an alarm lol
* **Starting dosage**: Your weight, height, and gender have exactly nothing to do with starting dosage. It's all about your genetics. He has very heavy patients who take almost none and tiny patients who take a lot
* **Starting a new stimulant med**: The side effects will be the worst the first two weeks. If it's helping your ADHD and the side effects aren't completely unbearable tough it out for at least two weeks before reducing dose or trying a different med
* **You can be very smart and still have the condition**: My doctor is very smart and successful despite also having high functioning autism in addition to ADHD. Many psychologists will assume you have anxiety, BPD, etc. Ask your psych to let you try meds for a limited time (at least 3 months) then reevaluate. Smart people with ADHD are very difficult to diagnose but treatment can be life changing despite already performing acceptably in work and school
* **Therapy is the single best thing you can spend your money on if you need it**: I have personally never needed therapy but he is very open about his own mental health and mentioned it in passing

**Disclaimer**: I am not a doctor. This is second hand advice. My doctor is a primary care physician not a psych. These tips may not be true for all people with ADHD but they should be true for most. If any of these things don't apply to you your condition is still valid. Please see a mental health professional for further guidance

**TLDR**: Medication holidays are not worth it, you won't build tolerance for ever, take a dose 1 hour before you need to get out of bed, smart/successful people can have ADHD too, therapy is awesome

**Edit: Something else I just remembered**: Attention is nothing more than the combination of motivation + memory. I wasn't sure if the meds were helping at first because they only seemed to help with motivation. I was concerned that I actually had high functioning depression instead of ADHD but this completely changed (and blew) my mind. Also I noticed that my memory was being improved later on",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ma499k/my_doctor_is_a_god_of_adhd_treatment_he_has_adhd/,True,False

 - **The Mask** - The timid, awkward, and shy office worker turns into a wild life of a party by compulsively relying on a social mask to hide his real self so that he comes off as a more appealing and entertaining person?
 - **Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind** - Constantly falling into a trap of returning to past relationships as soon as they end, having forgotten why the relationship failed and preventing you from moving forward?
 - **Me, Myself, & Irene** - The dual nature of ADHD that makes you both extremely caring and extremely volatile at a drop of a hat, and the feeling of powerlessness trying to exert any form of control?
 - **Dumb & Dumber** - The clutzy, airheaded, and quirky nature of ADHD making you feel like a complete idiot, whether you are one or not?
 - **Yes Man** - The constant overthinking, anxiety and cynicism thwarting your life from moving forward, so you compulsively begin doing things you don't even want to do because you're afraid of regretting on missing out on not doing it, leading you to feeling overwhelmed and strained, but unable to say no due to ominous dread that saying no will make bad shit happen and cause you to fall back to square one?
 - **Bruce Almighty** - The feeling that the universe is out to get you and screw you over, falling back on power fantasies of how things would be better if you were more fortunate not recognizing that the problem may not necessarily be with your current situation but your frame of mind?
 - **The Truman Show** - The feeling that your life is just a big act to fit in with society, and the struggle to break free from societal expectations once you recognize the boundaries you're trapped within?
 - **Liar Liar** - The pathological lying that comes as a result of trying to always say the right thing becoming so deeply ingrained that you become incapable of functioning honestly?

For example I have a friend who is a musician and a total music freak. He loves certain bands, plays and writes similar music and has a bunch of friends who are into the same thing. They go to gigs together etc. I have another friend who is really outdoorsy and into fitness. He goes on hikes, trips and exercises and is really into all aspects of his interests. You get the picture..

Then there is me. My hobbies and interests are forever changing so often that nobody can keep up. I cling too then abandon things so quickly that it can barely be classed as a hobby. Everything is just a fleeting obsession. I have never had something I could cling onto and build upon. I have no sense of identity.

For those who are scared they might have lymohoma, please rest assured that it is one of the most treatable cancers out there, even at stage 4.

Hell, I’d even consider myself to be pretty decent at writing, I just take forever to do it.

But, speaking? Transcribing abstract thoughts in my head into a series of sounds that I can’t even guarantee will be interpreted by the listener the way I mean it? *But then also having to do that shit live?* I can’t even recall what I said 10 seconds ago, let alone keep track of my thoughts in real time in such a way that ensures that the thing I’m trying to convey comes out the way I mean it. 

I think it’s at the root of some of my greatest anxieties in life, and is something that I dwell upon every single day. In any spoken interaction, I know that all it takes is a single moment where my mouth moves before I can ‘review’ my own words. And then it’s too late.

In most day-to-day interactions, the consequences tend to be pretty benign — until they’re not. I live in a constant fear of that; the persisting fear of mindlessly saying some stupid shit that’ll ruin my day, or weekend, or whatever. And so instead, I’ve learned to stay shut as much as I can. People typically think of me as being the “quiet type”, and in a way I certainly am an introvert — but I don’t necessarily want to be. I’m just locked in my own head.

But then there’s the *non*-day-to-day interactions. Those real important ones. Like having a crucial talk with my advisor about my research, where I need to be sharp and on top my wits and prove that I know my shit. Or in really important, “difficult” discussions with my girlfriend, where I need to communicate deep emotional thoughts whilst knowing that every word I say could carry a mountain of weight to it. Or god forbid, trying to speak to an audience, when every 20 seconds I get distracted from speaking by spontaneously becoming aware of the fact that I am, in fact, currently speaking. In these contexts, I’ll either become completely incoherent, or find myself “locked in” in my own mind, unable to form words. And it’s the absolute worst.

I sincerely don’t think I’ve ever been able to communicate any of this to anybody before. And I think a big reason is *because* of how difficult communicating things can be due to this. But, having just discovered this subreddit, I felt like I finally could. I became almost overwhelmed just from reading these posts from other, similar people who struggle like I do.

Many people with ADHD are not ""hyperactive,"" and most adults don't display that symptom in the traditional sense. I.e. I am an introvert and anxious. At times of high energy and low anxiety, I am hyperactive. But I'm rarely high energy, and I'm rarely low anxiety. Heck, and alcohol actually gives me more self-control while it kicks in. The hyperactivity is just a result of unregulated energy, and it's the *lack of regulation* that is the disorder, not the hyperactivity.

I have been complaining more and more to my GF about how much I need a break from work for the last month. So today I said screw it and took the day off. 

My GF, who is wonderful and caring and amazing, said that today I should do anything I wanted. Make a day about myself. Suggesting I go for a walk, head in to town and buy lunch etc.

Typical activities to refresh the mind. Smart, no reason not to. I like walks, and I like buying food. And I'll feel better and will be good to get away from the computer and get some fresh air. 

What I ended up doing was sitting in front of my computer drawing trees on a fantasy map for 10 hours straight. Maybe 5000 trees. By the end of the day I felt worse than I did in the morning. I hadn't eaten, had hardly moved. My back and kneck were hurting. Wow so rested.

My GF got home around 11pm to see me doing this. Laughing when she saw how I had spent my day. She was surpsied this is how I *wanted* to spend my precious day off. 

The word 'wanted' rang in my head as I sat there wanting to tell her   
""But.. this isn't what I wanted to do...""

Which then made me really depressed because no ones understands this, I don't have to exectuive function necasary to step by step a day of rest. I can't manufacture my own calm. 

And then my GF makes the very reasonable assumption in assuming I'll be feeling good since I spent the day chilling doing my thing.

xanrwt,I made a simple joke that lead to a discovery for a woman in her 60's,Fatastrophe,5037,2022-09-10 05:07:18,207,"I was at work a couple months ago speaking to a vendor. She was very energetic and seamlessly bouncing from topic to topic. I was following along just fine because I'm used to it but she caught herself, laughed, and apologized to me saying that she can be exhausting to talk to sometimes. I chuckled and said ""Don't worry about it, I have ADHD too.""

Normally I would never be so forward but in the 10 minutes I talked with her, there was no mistaking it. She tilted her head, looked a bit surprised yet intrigued and asked ""Why did you assume I have ADHD?"" I immediately started back-peddling because I thought maybe I offended her but she stopped me and said, ""It's pretty normal for a friend of mine or a family member to joke that I have ADHD but never someone I just met and barely know, so what is it about me that made you think that?"" Now, she isn't mad at all, if anything she's almost enjoying it. I tell her a bit about how I can get when I'm not medicated and how it aligned with how she was acting. She asked more questions and, among other things, I told her about ADHD paralysis.

It was like a penny that was hanging in the air for the past 60 years for her finally dropped. She said all this time she thought she was crazy, or lazy, or stupid, that she was never able to adequately explain why she wouldn't be able to move or start a task and that she never knew it was a common enough experience to have a name. We ended up talking for over an hour, by the end of it I helped her get set up with my ADHD specialist and she thanked me and went on her way.

Yesterday she came back to see me with updates that she got evaluated and she does indeed have ADHD! She said the next time I see her she'll be medicated with Adderall. She was so grateful for our chance encounter and said that conversation helped her understand that she wasn't an ""other"" and gave her peace of mind knowing that she wasn't any more crazy than the rest of us. So yeah, sometimes all it takes is an off-hand comment or joke to start a conversation that can lead to potentially changing someone's life!

Tell people “I have a memory disorder” instead.

Only mention ADHD if people want you to elaborate (they often don’t, however), by which point you have caused that person to think for a second about the way they see ADHD as something more serious than “can’t sit still disease.”

Unfortunately, people don’t understand ADHD, but that doesn’t mean you have to deal with the fallout of people misunderstanding the severity when it matters most that you are understood. If you say the way it impacts you instead, that also shows without confusion to the other person what is challenging you.

Other useful phrases;

“I have a disorder that causes time blindness, so I am going to need some leeway on the time frame for arriving.”

“I have a neurological condition that causes short term memory loss, can you write that down for me?”

“I have a brain disorder that severely impairs the way I process information so I may do things differently to you, but I can assure you that I am very capable when given the understanding!”

(I just used the memory disorder line on an important phone call, and that got a concerned “oh I see” and I was bumped up the chain of command, it really works.)",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/jrkqt5/dont_tell_people_you_have_adhd_describe_it_instead/,True,False

I feel like the rise in people who think they have ADHD is a part of this. ADHD has become common and if you have ADHD you’ll be compared to *X other person who has ADHD*. What I feel people have forgotten is how severe ADHD can be. I feel like ADHD is a spectrum like autism, where some people are only mildly affected by the disorder and just need pills to help them and some people are severely affected and though pills help a little they still struggle. I'm in the latter camp.

I have severe ADHD. People don’t see the struggle for motivation that goes on inside my head. They only see the mess I made, the deadline I missed, the text I forgot to respond to. They see the physical consequences of my disorder but they can’t see how much it affects me mentally. They can’t see the years of self flagellation I inflicted on myself because I felt stupid, incompetent, and worthless. They can’t see how my brain shuts itself down if it lacks something to keep it stimulated. My ADHD actually forces me to sleep if it finds something too boring. They only see how *X* person with ADHD is better than me and ask me why I can’t just be like them.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/n439p2/not_enough_people_realize_how_severe_adhd_can_be/,True,False

They romanticize it like it's some cutesy thing kids do because they're curious or bored.

ADHD ruins people's ability to perform well in life. It gets in the way of EVERYTHING. ADHD doesn't ""get better with age"" it just manifests itself differently, and oftentimes having to transition into an adult is harder on the individual. 

Those who were diagnosed late may have lived their whole lives up until that point thinking that they were lazy, broken, worthless and pathetic. People saw them as such. They were raised to think that of themselves. Deep rooted trauma due to untreated ADHD is REAL.

I'm 22 years old. My birthday present this year was my ADHD diagnosis. After two decades of struggling with this unknowingly, I finally have an answer to the question: ""Why am I like this?"". I finally have the next step into a better path for my health and wellbeing. 

For anyone who was diagnosed late: i see you. I understand. You are not alone. You are not worthless, you are not broken, you are not useless. Do not let the opinions of people in your past define how you see yourself today.

And for any self-diagnosed adults, or undiagnosed adults with suspicions: get an assessment. Trust me when I say, the answer might be expensive (depending on where you live) but the result is worth it. The relief you feel once your suspicions are confirmed is beyond validating.

But after learning that I/we have a focus disability, I believe if any normal person had motivation equal to that of an ADHD person, they would conquer the world.",Captain_Pumpkinhead,4823,2021-09-27 08:58:44,434,"This might be different for people who are only hyperactive, I don't know how that affects you guys. (I'm primarily inattentive)

How many times have we set up schedules, device reminders/alarms, tried associating certain tasks to certain other tasks, locked apps/devices/distractions, etc., all just to accomplish normal things?  How many of us have started running/lifting/exercising just to get bored and not really do anything while there and to end up not going next time?  Then we try again, fail, try again, get frustrated, just to try again and fail later?  Eventually we get discouraged and quit for a while, just to get frustrated and try again later.

We don't lack motivation, not at all, we just lack control over our focus.  No normal person is like this.  They just...do things.  When they want to.  They might struggle sometimes, but never to this extent.  And because of that, they don't have _nearly_ as much motivation as _we_ do.  No one is more motivated than someone who feels like they _should_ be able to make it work _if only they could just try harder._

Imagine what we could have accomplished with all this motivation if we didn't have this disability.  Think of that goal you gave up on because you just couldn't get the hard stuff done.  Think of all the wasted time trying and failing at homework that could've been used in a different way if we were able to finish this stuff in time.

If we kept the motivation level and just gained a normal person's focus control, I think we'd all have accomplished incredible things.

I don't remember the exact year that my wife and I had him diagnosed, but I always knew he had it.  My wife didn't always know, but that's a long story for another post.

Many of you are probably wondering what the point of this post is.  Maybe I am too.  But I have been lurking here occasionally, and some of the stories I read break my heart.

So here's my message to this community...


It's okay.  

It's okay that I asked you to take out the trash and you forgot.  It's just trash.

It's okay that sometimes you're late for school, and sometimes you forget to bring your homework home.  What I care about are the other times.  The times you come home happy that you made a new friend, or that you got an A.  Or a B.  Or a C.  It's just school.

It's okay that you are sometimes irritable.  Irritating.  Infuriating.  You're also kind.  Humble.  Caring.  Amazing.  Beautiful.  And that's more than just okay.

It's okay that sometimes you're a little hard to follow.   That sometimes you talk about three different things at once.  I wish I knew as much as you, that I had the passion that you have about the things that excite you.  

It's okay if you choose to take medication to make your life easier.  Don't like meds?  That's okay too.

The point is this.  You are all wonderful, beautiful, amazing people.  You come from all walks of life.   You've all taken a different path.  Just know that there are people who care about you.  There are people who get you.  There are people who love you, and want you to be happy.

It will be okay.

Like so many others on here, I’ve tried several times to come up with ways to explain what it’s like. How this isn’t just “trouble sitting still disorder” like people think.

If you’ve ever worked retail, you’re probably familiar with the easiest way to piss off a coworker while they cash out a drawer. Just stand next to them and say random numbers in the middle of their count. The first time it happens to you, you think it’s kinda funny.... every time after that, you think like Ernie preparing to commit a hate crime. It’s the end of the shift. You’ve pushed through the sensation of barbed wire wrapped around your throat while dealing with entitled shitlords. It’s late, you’re exhausted, and miserable. All you want to do is accept defeat, take the L, and go home to cry. 

I had her do it and after several tries she finally got it. But then I had my roommate chime in and she couldn’t make it past both voices. And then it clicked; every sound, or visual stimulus, or smell, or intrusive thought is a shitty coworker yelling out numbers. On good days maybe there’s only 2 or 3, whereas bad days have 10 or more. Sometimes they have megaphones and shout obscenities, other times it feels like they’re actually choking you. 24/7/365, rain or shine, they never fail to show up and destroy any sense of continuity or flow.

Anyway because there was only five of us older teens, we got put in games with this party of a bunch of 10 year olds and their parents. And there’s this one girl who just could not focus or sit still, and her dad was blushing real hard as he tried to get her to be quiet. 

Her dad apologised to the chick doing the rules and stuff after she had finished and explained that his kid had ADHD. 

(now what I did probably wasn’t the smartest move) I, also an ADHDer with no real filter, spun around and said “Same!” and gave the kid a high five. 

This kid. She just- beamed! Apparently she had gotten diagnosed only recently and hadn’t met any other people with it yet. Anyway, she started babbling, I of course continued the conversation, also babbling. 

I found out that she’s real into the avengers at the moment, and as a former marvel nerd, I threw some quick hit facts from my glory days. It was fun! 

We paired together in the pairs game, and came 3rd! Beat only by two of my friends and then a father and son duo. 

After the games had ended for the 10 year olds (us older teens had one more game left). and the party was packing up, the dad of the kid came over and thanked me. 

It wasn’t a big flashy thank you, but he just said thank you for being kind and that I made her day. 

Nothing really important, but it serves to remind me that when I feel like shit cause of ADHD, i was good enough for that kid, i understood her, and that’s a good thing to know.

r2zi3r,I spent over 500 days trying productivity apps so that you don't have to. Here are my results.,EelOfEsoterica,4624,2021-11-26 15:22:05,350,"Hello! So this is a really really long post. If you are like me and can’t read it all, that’s fine! Take it at your speed, and I included a quick summary at the end of each section and also at the end end. I also made subtitles and generally tried to keep it organized. Also, disclaimer that this is just my experience and you might love something I hated.

Okay, so let’s start by going through my methodology.

I tried a grand total of 36 (yep) apps and services, split into some broad categories. Routine-setting (i.e. to help with time blindness and doing things on time), to-do (for keeping lists), productivity (things that combine the two above), health and fitness (to be healthy), and habit building (to… build habits). I tried each service for a minimum of 2 weeks, and eliminated any other systems I had that would interfere with features (for example when using to-do lists I deleted any other to-do list apps I had). This took me a grand total of 550 days (including some breaks). For the purposes of this, I did not factor in cost, and I also didn’t try every app I wanted to (honestly it’s tiring shifting your entire life over every 2 weeks). So, the structure I follow for these short reviews is a 1-2 sentence review, and a some criteria to help you decide whether it’s the right app for you. As for my review, I graded it against my personal deficiencies (I have time-blindness, love stats, task initiation problems, super easily overwhelmed, need rewards, can’t focus, pretty bad emotional dysregulation, etc). It should also be noted that I am a student and so evaluated it for my student life, so my ratings are not completely universal. It’s all good if you disagree!

Here goes:

**CATEGORY 1: ROUTINE SETTING**

***Tiimo:***

REVIEW: I thoroughly enjoyed using the app (actually continued using it past the 14 day trial period). While it was a bit buggy on android, all the other operating systems work. My biggest “good thing” about it is that the visual timer actually keeps me on task a quarter of the time (yes, it sounds stupid but that is monumental). Do keep in mind that you can’t reschedule or move anything, so this works best for people with rigid schedules

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You need reminders to start and also to stop
* You are a visual thinker who likes the timer wheel thingy
* Your daily/weekly/monthly schedule stays much the same

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You need to be able to move things around in your day super easily
* Icons/colours/personalization options just distract you
* You aren’t willing to spend a lot of time in set up

***Routinery:***

REVIEW: I also thoroughly enjoyed using this one - the interface was clean and nice and easy. The free version only includes 3 routines, which is not enough for many people. Even so, I found the fact that you could move tasks around so helpful.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* Your daily schedule is variable, you need flexibility
* You want to track the time things actually take you
* The pressure of a countdown timer keeps you motivated

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You get so hyperfocused that you don’t move forward for 7 hours
* You are a visual thinker for whom countdowns do not work
* You have many unmovable times for tasks

***Fabulous:***

REVIEW: Honestly, I disliked it. From the start I kinda felt that it was trying to shape my morning, and there were very few options for customization. However, the colours worked well together and would it have been more friendly for my schedule, I could definitely see myself using it.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like pre-made routines
* Visual appeal of the app is important to you
* You need some help figuring out a healthy routine

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You already have a set routine
* You want a simple app
* You don’t want a storyline

***Habit Now:***

REVIEW: The platform was easy to set up, however, this app just didn’t meet my needs, especially in terms of time-blindness help and figuring out exactly what I needed to do right then. I would say it’s more of a habit app than a routine app.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like tracking what you do
* Stats help you improve
* You like seeing the day at a glance

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You need reminders
* You find timeblocking most helpful
* You have a good amount of time blindness

***TimeTune:***

REVIEW: I liked the app, but it was a bit hard to figure out app of the different settings and exactly how to make a routine. As a serial procrastinator, I found it almost a bit too easy to just remove something altogether. Not quite for me.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You really like timeblocking
* You categorize your day
* You love widgets

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* Your tasks change times frequently
* Timeblocking just isn’t your vibe
* You need a visual countdown

***My Morning Routine:***

REVIEW: This was so easy and nice to figure out. I had completely made my routines in about an hour, and despite not really reminding me to get started (something I need), I was drawn to the clear UI of the app.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You want something super basic and easy to get the hang of
* You like the circular timer
* You can start your routines at any time

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You have a lot of set times
* You need an advanced tracker
* You have many flexible, movable tasks

***Brili:***

REVIEW: I found it extremely hard to cope with the font - It kept bothering me an unreasonable amount. That aside, it was helpful, but I got overwhelmed pretty easily seeing my day as a list. Apart from those two things, it was a very good app.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like to move tasks around a lot
* You like having multiple views of your tasks
* You like getting trophies

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You feel overwhelmed seeing all your tasks in list form
* You need an aesthetic app
* The amount of icons will distract you

**CATEGORY 2: TO-DO:**

***Todoist:***

REVIEW: It’s a basic to-do list app. Pretty smooth and easy. Dark mode is pleasant, lots of options to organize your to-dos.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You just need a list
* You like to tag, organize, and place subtasks
* You enjoy extensive text processing

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You need some kind of reward for checking off tasks
* The 1000 levels of prioritization and organization is overwhelming
* You want a “funner” to-do list

***Asana:***

REVIEW: While I liked Asana, I found it very confusing to both set up and actually use - however, the parts I could figure out were great.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You have a very complex and specific system
* You also want to see status/priority, etc
* You work with other people

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You want something simpler
* You want a reward for checking off tasks
* You get easily overwhlemed

***Water Do:***

REVIEW: This was one of my favourite apps - the UI was super clean and fun to use and I actually got disappointed when I ran out of things to do. I really enjoyed using this for the two weeks and plan to continue using it.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You want an aesthetic app
* You need a daily review
* You need a reward for finishing tasks

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You have a lot of tasks
* You need to be able to see all your tasks at once
* Your tasks have specific times

***To Round:***

REVIEW: Once again, I found myself getting disappointed when I ran out of things to do in my day - however the fact that there were no repeating tasks made it hard to navigate. Would they have repeating tasks, this app would be amazing.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You need a reward for completing tasks
* You like to set priorities
* Your tasks change daily

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You have a lot of repeating tasks
* You have a large amount of tasks
* You find the game-ified aspect too distracting

***Any.do:***

REVIEW: I enjoyed using Any.do, but it just didn’t give me the reward for finishing a task that I need to be productive.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You use iOS, android and browser
* You just need a list
* You have a simple system and workflow

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You have a more complex/specific workflow
* You work offline a lot
* You need a reward for finishing tasks

***Trello:***

REVIEW: I found the initial setup of trello hard, however beyond that it was easy and fun. It didn’t meet my need of having a reward though.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You have a specific workflow
* You are a visual person
* You work with other people

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You want a simple system
* You are easily overwhelmed
* You need a reward for completing a task

***TickTick:***

REVIEW: I liked using TickTick, but I got really overwhelmed looking at my tasks for the day, which made it a lot harder to stick to the system.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You want something easy to pick up on
* You like prioritizing tasks
* You need a calendar view

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You get easily overwhelmed
* You need a reward for finishing tasks
* You are easily overwhelmed

***Egenda:***

REVIEW: I really liked the simplicity of egenda, it was also super easy to figure out what I should be doing next/at all.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* Everything you do has a deadline
* You like categorizing
* You want something simple

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* Your tasks are flexible
* You need subtasks
* You need rewards for finishing tasks

**CATEGORY 3: PRODUCTIVITY:**

***Focus To-Do:***

REVIEW: I liked Focus To-Do, though I found that I never actually used the tasks and to-do list options, and sometimes it glitched and reset all my pomodoros.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You want to integrate your task list with your pomodoros
* You need to be able to customize your pomodoro time
* You use many operating systems

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You want a simpler timer
* You find customization overwhelming
* You already have an ideal to-do list app

***Forest:***

REVIEW: I liked forest, however I did not find it that useful as I just stopped the app whenever my brain decided to be distracted again. Also, I had no major problem with just thinking instead of working.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You won’t just stare at the wall instead of doing work
* You have a moral objection to killing a fake/virtual tree
* You have enough self-discipline to actually turn it on

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You will gladly kill the fake tree
* You need reminders to use a system
* Your biggest distraction is something other than your devices

***Slash:***

REVIEW: I found slash to be a bit too rigid for my purposes, however, I can definitely see why it got popular and I understand why many people love it.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You need to be told what to do
* You want to track the time tasks take you
* You won’t get hyperfocused and just not check it

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You already have a to-do list you like
* You have many repeating tasks
* You have tasks that have specific times

***Monday.com***

REVIEW: I truly enjoyed using Monday.com as a stat fanatic, it was infinitely customizable, however sometimes that can be a bit overwhelming.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You really love stats
* You work with a team
* You need to track many things

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You want something simple
* You need a lot of reminders
* You want your done tasks to just dissapear

***Habitica:***

REVIEW: While habitica was an enjoyable and fun romp through my day, I felt that I spent a lot more time just playing around than actually getting stuff done.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You love video games
* You like the division into habits, tasks, and one-offs
* You like being in a community

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You will be distracted by the game mechanisms
* Leveling up your character has no appeal to you
* You like to prioritize

***Friday:***

REVIEW: I liked friday a lot, however I found it a bit hard to get the hang of at first, and too complex for my personal workflow.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You have a very specific organizational style
* You want to be able to integrate with other apps
* You like the timeblocking method

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You want something simple
* You’re easily overwhelmed
* You constantly change apps to manage your life

***Taskito:***

REVIEW: Taskito did not really work for me, as almost all my tasks are movable throughout the day (so I couldn’t benefit from the timeline). However, it’s a very well-designed app.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like timelines
* You also need a to-do list
* You like being able to see your work in many different ways

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You suffer from time-blindness
* Your tasks are movable
* You find too many different views overwhelming

***HourStack:***

REVIEW: I liked hourstack, I can see why it would work for some people, however it just didn’t match with my workflow or brain.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You enjoy timeblocking
* You work with others
* Your tasks have set times

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You’re easily overwhelmed
* You need a checklist

* You need more customization
* Your tasks are movable
* You’re easily overwhelmed

**CATEGORY 4: HEALTH AND FITNESS**

***Daylio:***

REVIEW: I really liked using daylio, especially as someone who constantly wants to journal but hates writing. The option to log what I do and see the stats surround it really helped me keep track of how to make my days a bit less hard.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You don’t like writing
* You need a fast way to track your mood
* You like stats

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You like to go in detail about your day
* What you do changes on a daily basis
* You enjoy writing

***Flo:***

REVIEW: If you are a person with a period who also has ADHD, you most likely know the pain of never knowing when your period is going to come. To that end, Flo is helpful since it sends you notifications. On the bad side, it is a bit hard to log symptoms.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like logging many symptoms and tracking lots of things
* You also potentially want to track pregnancy
* You enjoy social interaction

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You’re looking to only track a couple specific symptoms
* You really don’t like social interaction
* Ads are very distracting to you

***Headspace:***

REVIEW: I didn’t really love the meditations that were on headspace, but it was occasionally helpful with my emotional dysregulation to just slow down and stop. I found that just breathing slower on my own was equally helpful though.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like guided meditations
* You are a bit short on time
* You have mood swings

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You find deep breathing really difficult
* You want to meditate for longer periods
* You won’t actually open the app

***Finch Self Care:***

REVIEW: I dislike writing about my day (or at least I’m terrible at it), so I didn’t like the focus on writing, however, the pet aspect was really nice.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You really like writing
* You need prompts
* The idea of a little pet amuses you

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You hate writing
* The pet will distract you
* You’re really short on time

***Clue:***

REVIEW: I enjoyed the visual interface of Clue, and found the short articles both helpful and fun to read. Overall, an excellent tracker app for my needs.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You want to track custom symptoms
* You like the circle diagram
* You like stats

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* Your symptoms change a lot
* You dislike the circle diagram and prefer a calendar view
* You like to write notes about your period

***Plant Nanny:***

REVIEW: In general, I did not love plant nanny, as I found it hard to understand and not that motivating (I just didn’t care about the plant). If you are a plant person though, you might like it.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You want a visual tracker
* The idea of a game is exciting to you
* You need reminders to drink water

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* The idea of a game is distracting to you
* You won’t really care about the plant
* You want an easy, simple system

**CATEGORY 5: HABIT BUILDING:**

***Productive:***

REVIEW: I really enjoyed productive! It was easy to use and fun to keep on track with. There were some minor bugs but nothing that kept it from being functional.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You want an easy system to keep track of your habits
* You have specific times for some of your habits and not others
* You like icons and colours

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You find too much personalization distracting
* You need tangible rewards for doing your habits
* You need extensive stats

***RabitHabit:***

REVIEW: While I liked using RabitHabit, I found that it pushed me to set times for almost all my habits (i.e. drinking water doesn’t always take the same amount of time). So, I found that inhibited much of my enjoyment.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like a story-line and structure to learning habits
* You want a timer for your habits
* You like stats

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* Your habits don’t really have times
* You will get distracted by the story-line
* You aren’t a visual learner

***HabitHub:***

REVIEW: While HabitHub is definitely a good app, I just found myself getting really overwhelmed with all the different habits and tracker just there. But if you like seeing all of it at once I can see why this would be a good app.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You really like stats
* You aren’t visual
* You need to be able to see your habits at a glance

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You’re visual
* You get easily overwhelmed
* You need an aesthetic app

***Loop Habit Tracker:***

REVIEW: I actually really liked Loop Habit Tracker, even though I really only wanted to track a couple habits. It was really effective and I enjoyed the stats.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like one-click trackers
* You like stats
* You like seeing all your habits at once

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You’re easily overwhelmed
* You only want to track a couple habits
* You want something really simple

***Habit Forest:***

REVIEW: Habit Forest was a fun app to use, but I found myself way too distracted with my forest which made it harder to actually do any of the habits I set out to do.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You like games
* You need a reward for completing your habits
* You want an aesthetic app

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* You’re easily distracted
* You want something simple
* You have a lot of habits you want to build

***Habit Tracker: Daily Planner:***

REVIEW: While the visual appeal of this app was amazing, most of my habits (drinking water, etc) need to be repeated throughout the day, and I simply don’t need to know that I drank one glass of water at 1:34pm.

MIGHT BE GOOD FOR YOU IF:

* You’re visual
* You like stats
* You want to be able to recap what you did in the day

MIGHT BE BAD FOR YOU IF:

* Most of your habits need to be repeated throughout the day
* Your habits don’t have specific times
* You find the personalization distracting

**SOME CLOSING WORDS:**

So that’s the end! 550 days of work for 3500 words. At the end of the day, the apps I ended up wanting to use after the two week period were: Tiimo, Routinery, Water Do, Monday.com, Daylio and Productive (they all made the best in this category section). Making this list was a little bit very exhausting so I hope that it helps at least one person :)

And also it should be noted that I still don’t have a system that totally works. Thanks, brain.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/r2zi3r/i_spent_over_500_days_trying_productivity_apps_so/,True,False
nf8zua,I have brushed and flossed for 41 WEEKS straight!,Romecat,4617,2021-05-18 05:06:58,157,"For the first time in my 50+ years, I am actually excited to go to the dentist today. Prior to this I had never even managed to do both for the week before or after an appointment.

I have brushed and flossed for every single one of the **287 days** since my last appointment in August.

I was so disappointed when I rescheduled my previous appointment, but they aren't as covid aware as I would like. However, it has now been 13 days since my second shot, so I'm willing to chance it.

I fully expect them to say, ""*Romecat! What are you even doing here? Obviously you went to different dentist in the interim? Stop wasting our time!*""

TL;DR  I am a dental hygiene goddess and am really, really proud of myself!!

Edit:

So, I just found out that I am the type of person who posts, *""Thank you SO much for the awards!!""*

Normally I would feel embarrassed about being so proud of (what non-ADDers consider to be) basic hygiene, but it took me 4.5 decades to get here, so....

For my fellow ADDers:

My type is off-the-charts inattentive and I wasn't diagnosed until I was 40 so I have a LOT of *""You just need to try harder,""* baggage.

I have tried 5-6 meds and have untenable side effects to them all, so I am kind of pissed off in general. LOL

Obviously, the basic answer to how I did it is, ""I just did."" But that is a completely *worthless* response.

Last year I saw someone post about flossing for 30 days in a row and I was so freaking proud of them and was pleasantly surprised by how few snarky responses there were. I thought, I could do that.

But it wasn't until my appointment last August where I was fucking mortified by how bad it had gotten that I vowed to not let that happen again.

Even though I pay for dental insurance and have 2 ""free"" cleanings and 1 ""free"" exam per year, I had not been in 5 years. I also wasted up to $10k's worth of 50% coverage. There were more than a dozen factors that lead to that, but it still makes zero sense.

I put dental floss everywhere! Both bathrooms, by the sofa in the living room *(I don't care if that sounds gross,)* and by my bed.

My bottom teeth are really crowded because I lost my retainer when I was 15--shocker! I have to use waxed and I started tying a 12"" long piece in a loop since that made it easier to reach my back teeth and less likely to shred than using a pick.

Charts don't work for me so I just kept a, *""There is no way I am breaking this streak,""* mindset. We went on an overnight trip and I packed dental floss 3 different times, just in case any went missing. A LOT of things go missing whenever I am involved.

One of my main motivations was to post here.

All of this to say that if I can do it then I really believe that you can, too!!

 

Update, per request. How it actually went down.

I managed to get there at 3pm *on the dot*\--it was 12 miles away, so it took about 20 minutes so I was already winning from the get go. LOL

Dental Hygienist *How are you doi*

Romecat ***I FLOSSED AND BRUSHED EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE MY LAST CLEANING!!***

DH *Um, that's good, yeah, um, some people have trouble sticking to that, so um*

RC ***IT WAS 287 DAYS! I BRUSHED AND FLOSSED ON EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM!!***

DH *Okay. Would you like to take a seat?*

The cleaning was awesome! I need to focus a bit more at the base of where my teeth are really crowded, but it was a breeze.

My dentist comes in to check things out.

RC   ***I FLOSSED AND BRUSHED EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE MY LAST CLEANING!! IT WAS 287 DAYS!!***

She was super proud of me. I'm sure she remembers how bad it was last time. She gave my teeth the once over and said, *""Everything looks great and there is nothing to follow up on. See you in 6 months!""*

But I have no idea.

So yesterday, I met with my boss, and confessed that I had no idea.  I suggested that I could dig through virtual meeting records to add up time, etc.  But that, off-handed, I just couldn’t give an accurate answer.

I told him that I recently learned about a symptom of ADHD called “time-blindness,” and that it probably contributes to why I struggle to estimate project timelines.

His reaction?

“Wow.  I’ve never had to think about my time like that.  I’ve taken it for granted my whole life.”

And then he reassured me that he only needed my “best guess,” and helped me estimate my biggest project.

EDIT:  Wow!  Any mods (or bots or experts) out there who can add a definition and example of time-blindness to this post?

Of course I took one sip and then lost it in the abyss for the next 6 hours while I tried to pack my house up and it went cold, so I popped it in the microwave for round two.

Next thing you know it’s 2 days later and I’m unpacking my things at my new house, 78 miles away, when I notice a box leaking…

For **9 years** I never told my work I have ADHD because I was afraid they'd judge me and it would only have a negative impact. Also everyone said it was a bad idea to tell your work. I had to pretend I was neurotypical and it got SO exhausting.

I just started a new job at a new company and *finally* said ""fuck pretending, I'm going to be my genuine self now"" and I told my manager and my whole team I have ADHD. I explained how ADHD makes me work differently, struggles I face, my superpowers (hyperfocus and creativity), things that help me succeed, and that ADHD has no impact on intelligence. They were SO understanding and they made these accommodations:

- They let me record meetings. I told them that sometimes I miss key words or I need to re-listen to really understand. This helps IMMENSELY because I can listen to something 3 or 4 times and truly soak it in.

- My manager helps me plan out the week in our Monday meeting. She helps me put together concrete steps, which is so helpful.

- My manager understands that I need breaks when I'm overthinking/overwhelmed.

- They give me opportunities to apply my creativity so I'm not stuck with just mind-numbing tasks

What's even more amazing is that my manager, who is a *Vice President*, shared that she has ADD and dyslexia. She even talked about her anxiety and insomnia. I've never heard an executive admit to having mental health conditions. It gave me hope that I can move up in the corporate world - I always felt like there was a glass ceiling on promotions with ADHD.

I just wanted to share my story about a positive experience telling my work about my ADHD. I'm not saying anyone else should do the same because your team might react differently especially if they're not progressive on mental health. Sadly, talking about mental health at work is a calculated risk. But I'm incredibly happy about my outcome and I'm hopeful for the future. The accommodations have already helped me be successful and get good feedback. I hope others have success stories like this. Thank you for reading.

Edit: Thank you all for the amazing comments! I'm glad my story made people happy. I hope it inspires some people to talk about their ADHD.

kdtohx,"Paid 5 people back that I’ve owed money for like a month, deep cleaned my laundry and tidied the entire house with an ADHD hack I’ve heard in a few books.",Amethyst-Warrior,4581,2020-12-15 12:24:29,147,"**TLDR - I’ve organised a “power hour” with my mum 4x per week where we effectively swap being each others “life assistant” for an hour each day, 4x days a week.**

I’ve listened to multiple ADHD books that suggest “chore swapping” with a friend. I’ve had this idea to ask my mum if she’d be up for it for weeks but was convinced she would think it’s a stupid idea, but I finally asked her the other day if she’d be up for it and she was!

I have my assessment on Friday (low key terrified I will be told I’m just lazy/anxious/depressed and be prescribed another antidepressant) and my mum is almost has ADHD as well, although is in a little bit of denial.

So I called her the other day and proposed this:

1. At least 4 days a week, we will visit each other for 1 hour at roughly the same time, pending appointments.

2. We will not be upset if the other person is late and we only have an hour - if we’re late, we get less time. We will expect each other to be late so we aren’t upset.

3. We both have to be doing something, even if we don’t feel like it.

4. We will set a timer for an hour, with a reminder 5 minutes before the timer is up.

5. At the start of the hour we’ll set “goals” for the hour and keep each other on track.

6. We can help each other with anything - it’s not limited to cleaning. The example I gave my mum on the phone was that I’ve been struggling to start my tax return, so I just need someone to be there and keep pushing me to do it.

We had our first power hour yesterday and it was AMAZING. When my mum arrived (10 minutes late), I told her I had 5 people I had been meaning to pay back for various things, and that how dirty our laundry was was stressing me out. So she made me sit down and I wrote a list of who I had to pay back while she started the laundry.

She called out to me a few times from the laundry to make sure I hadn’t got distracted.

After I’d finished paying everyone back, I got up to help her with the laundry and she asked where our mop was. I said it was broken and I’d been meaning to order a new one, so she suggested I order it right then and there, so I did!

Once I’d finished that I neatened the entire house. I like to play a game in my head where I pretend I’m a realtor getting a house ready to be inspected but I only have a short time and can’t actually “clean” anything because it’ll take too long, I just have to make each room “look” good from a distance.

When the hour was up, the house was so tidy and the laundry was spotless. Today I’m going to visit my mum and we’re organising her pantry because it’s been stressing her out, and I’m so excited!

When my boyfriend came home he couldn’t believe how neat the house was and noticed the laundry right away. He asked me how I’d got it all done and I, shyly, told him about what I’d read in all the books and the arrangement with my mum, thinking he’d think it was stupid.

He (in a nutshell) said “...wow. That’s actually a really smart idea. You know I’d do that with you if there’s anything I can help you with.”

I just feel so warm and fuzzy and accomplished today and I wanted to share! Hope you guys get something out of this tip and have a friend or family member you can try it with :)

**TLDR - I’ve organised a “power hour” with my mum 4x per week where we effectively swap being each others “life assistant” for an hour each day, 4x days a week.**

I suspect the hierarchy for diagnosis, especially as a child is:

- Hyperactive/ disruptive regardless of intelligence 
- Inattentive with a parent who has it and knows the signs regardless of intelligence 
- Inattentive with average intelligence or less (may or may not be diagnosed as a child)
- Inattentive with high intelligence (unlikely to be diagnosed as a kid and perhaps at all)

Tbh I have no idea but recently 🤦‍♀️) someone posted about the adhd tax and I have not stopped thinking about it since. 

I was raised to believe that many of my adhd symptoms were just a result of general laziness, even though I was paralyzed by and severely depressed because of my executive disfunction. So shortcuts of any kind were frowned upon, and I always thought people who purchased precut/prepared foods at a premium were spoiled and lazy (and I worked so hard to not be seen that way, so I refused to do so even if it meant wasting and throwing away expired food frequently. Or losing weight and being nutritionally deficient because I couldn’t bring myself to prepare real food).

WELL this week when I went grocery shopping I bought a bunch of precut/pre-washed fruits and veggies, pre-cooked flash frozen salmon, and frozen microwaveable rice. I could cry I feel so relieved and validated. I didn’t feel bad about it once - I walked through the aisles floating lol. And my week has been SO MUCH BETTER because of it!

wf4t8r,"I don't ""miss"" people or get homesick and it's so frustratingly impossible to explain",Enryth,4552,2022-08-03 05:02:40,776,"i dont know if anyone else feels like this for sure.

but I often hear that I'm bad at responding to texts: because I am, granted. if I don't immediately respond as I get the message, it could take hours. even if we're having a ""conversation"" over text i sometimes just stop in the middle and don't reply.

and that also kind of applies to people. I have never in my life really, actually, felt homesick doing anything. when I was 16 I spent a year abroad and I never really ""missed"" or yearned my family's company. we only ever called once a month. 

recently my (long-distance) gf told me that she felt depressed about always being the one to text first and that it felt like I didn't really want her company. my perspective is very different. I put lots of effort into our relationship and I try very hard to balance time spent with her/friends/work/myself and always prioritize her company the highest — if I'm hanging out with friends or alone I drop whatever I'm doing as soon as she texts me.

but she's right. she always is the one who texts first. and I realised that that's how it is with all my friends and even family. if they didn't reach out first I wonder how many people I would just not talk to. but it's not because I don't care at all. it couldn't be further from the truth.

I've now set reminders on my phone to be reminded of her at least three times a day (morning, midday, evening).

we had a conversation about it and I tried my very best to explain to her that me not texting first is not about me not caring at all and that it's just a mixture of complete lack of time perception (now vs not now) and essentially just being distracted all the time. she's not taking it well at all. and I fully understand her and get why she doesn't take it well. it really sounds like I just don't care or that my brain thinks she's unimportant. but it's just so far from true. I don't know what to say to make her understand how that works. I'm scared that it's gonna be detrimental to our relationship and feel like I should almost just have lied, but I simultaneously refuse to build a relationship on that, for her sake and mine and because it would be so f****ing unfair to her. i just don't know what to say to her. I feel hopeless. i really love her but every word I say sounds like I don't. I don't know what to do.

edit: holy crap! reading the amount of support and similar experiences means so much to me. thank you all for your advice and kind words. I'm trying to read all the comments but there's so so many.

edit 2, update: started my first dose of methylphenidate today! at a pretty mild dose of 18 mg I still notice some level of distractibility and my time perception still seems kind of impaired, but oh my god it is also like a different world. after 20 minutes of taking it i went into my room and just.... cleaned it. it was so easy. and then afterwards i immediately went for a run. at no point did i feel overwhelmed with the urge to quit or cut corners. of course, the thoughts were still there, but they were so easily dismissed. i also notice that my fatique issues are almost completely nullified. at least for now. feeling really hopeful about this - let's see if it helps me stay in touch with friends and loved ones. i can already tell i might need a bigger dose because i do still get distracted, but this alone is a fucking incredible experience by comparison.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/wf4t8r/i_dont_miss_people_or_get_homesick_and_its_so/,True,False

I’ve been dodging in person lectures, specifically for this course, because of my anxiety building up around public speech setting of the course.

As a result, i was not prepared at all, as a result, I failed the final. He told me that I failed right after the 20 minute ended, and my heart dropped.

Then he started to ask me if there’s something going on in my life, etc. I explained how I’ve been missing classes & my recent diagnosis of ADHD/Anxiety and not having any support system or family, he was empathetic enough to disregard my current failed grade.

He also told me that he has anxiety himself, and he’d be able to coach me with dealing with speaking skills when you have anxiety, if I want. 

He’s also letting me re-do my final after my other finals would be finished, and tutor me for what i’ve missed. At this point I started crying. I’m unsure if this was because of pure embarrassment or because i haven’t felt like I deserve this level of support from anyone.

o69xd4,"I just finished three highschool classes at age 30. Started highschool at age 15, dropped out, almost finishing twice, dealing with depression, failure, failed attempts and more in the past 15 years. And now for the first time: I am god damn proud of myself!",TheBayer,4541,2021-06-23 03:14:36,216,"Hi :)  
Sorry for the rant, I just feel like sharing :)  
**TL:DR at the bottom**

I've tried finishing highschool (what is equivalent in Denmark) since I was 15 (in 2005). I was 3 months from finishing the 3 years, when I dropped out because I broke down. It was the worst years of my life at that point. Later (when I was 21) I was retroactively diagnosed with clinical depression from the age of 15. When I was 19, I tried finishing a 2 year compressed high school course, and that's when my depression really hit me, and I stopped attending with 4 months left. I was living on my own, and I basically hid for a few months in my apartment. After that I was diagnosed with depression and started on anti-depressants etc. A couple of times I tried taking a online courses to finish the subjects I was missing to get the full diploma, but I couldn't get through them. I've had nightmares of sitting in classrooms, the stress of having assignments due that I couldn't get done and all that stuff.

Fast forward to 2018. Working full time as a sales assistant in a retail store. I started cutting down on my antidepressants on my own, and finally in December 2018 I stopped, without withdrawals.  
4 months later I meet the girl of my dreams, and I got myself a girlfriend. I felt good. But I had a hard time relaxing, focusing and anxiety from too much talk, and thoughts about the future. Fast forward again to 2020. I decide, with my girlfriend's support, to slowly start taking a couple of courses online, so I can get my diploma. I'd start with 3 classes, two of the biggest, and one easier one: English (advanced foreign language), Danish (literature - biggest subject of all, in highschool), and Geography (introduction). These are all compressed 1-year courses. I start in September. But I am still stressed, anxious... my brain is overworked. Not because of the courses, but because of everything.  
In February I make an appointment with my doc, and after a talk she refers me to a psychiatrist and soon I am diagnosed with ADHD(ADD), I start taking my Ritalin (later Concerta), and later some Sertralin for my anxiety. It all works - it's awesome!!! LUCKILY because I of the Covid-19 situation most exams are cancelled, and I just have to have a casual conversation with some of the teachers, so they can assess a grade from the conversation and all my assignments. For 10+ years I've feared exams, and feared all of this... I've avoided it at all cost. ""Sadly"" it turns out that the Danish oral exam and written exam are not cancelled, because of the sheer size and importance of the class. It's hard, and my biggest fear tbh.

I know I'm decent at English, but I suck at the formalities, and at limiting my answers and understanding the questions, because I overanalyse everything. So I had no idea about what grades I would get.  
Geography I'm good at, since I like everything scientific and fact-based. But my teacher apparently didn't understand my reasoning in my reflection when I talked to her because I do a LOT of reflection. So I guess it can be confusing to people who don't.  
Danish I figured I would get a mediocre grade. I only read what was required to do the assignments, and I suck at remembering the formalities, and analyses, what to focus on etc. So I always have to start over, with every new assignment. I panicked when I found out I had to do an oral exam.

First was the written danish exam. 5 hours. I had planned my time, and what kind of assignment I would chose. The first hour I would use on reading the texts, form my opinion, and get ready to discuss the subject. The next three I would spend on writing, and the last hour I would use to read through the assignment and make corrections. At the exam... I spent the first 2,5 hours reading, analysing, forming an opinion, and get an idea of what to write... then I spent 1 hour trying to write, but I was stuck. Then I had a breakthrough and I spent 1,5 hours writing, and the last 5 minutes I got the formalities (headline, page number etc), but I never read it over or anything :o

Next was the oral exam... I had great plans to read up on all the subjects, but it was more of a quick glance at the curriculum. Then came the day, where I had my first REAL oral exam... I was sure I was going to fuck it up, but at least it would be over soon! I had feared this in all the years since I was 15... now 30.  
When I get there I drink some energy drink, my mind is all over...  
I go in to meet the examiners, and I play it as cool as I possibly can, make a joke, smile etc.  
I pull the question and the text, and get 50-60 minutes to prepare. I have no idea about what to do. I spent 40 minutes reading about the genre, and 15 minutes analysing the text.  
I come back in to the exam, and I start talking... I talk, I talk... after a while they ask me some questions, I have NO idea what to answer... But I talk and pretend... And suddenly the 30 minutes are up. I go outside and think... at least it's all over and I can do with a D or a C... after only 10 seconds they ask me to come back in.  
And immediately say: ""Well obviously you get an A!""  
I'm dumbfounded. What the fuck... I start laughing and I say ""WHAT? A? I thought maybe a C?"" but they assure me, I nailed it.  
I honestly can't believe it. How can I, someone who has had a deep fear of everything related to this, get the best possible grade in the subject I find the hardest?! For the first time since I can remember I felt proud! I had a real success! A feeling we rarely get with our ADHD brains... I called my girlfriend, she starts crying. I call my mom and my dad, they get so happy.

A few days later (yesterday) I get the grades for my other classes! Geography: A, English Oral: A, English Written: B and Danish Written: B!!!!  
I honestly can't believe it!! I had never ever thought I would be able to do this good! I've never lived up to my potential before, but I thought grades like that was unreachable for someone with my brain...  
I am proud of myself! I don't feel proud or happy all the time... but for a few seconds sometimes, I get a burst of a feeling I haven't felt before. Proudness! It's crazy.

Now, for the next year I'm going to take more classes, and cut down on work :) And after NEXT summer I'll start getting my bachelors degree.

For most of my life, I thought I was just “too sensitive” or “lazy” or “too much.” I learned how to adapt to what everyone needed from me at school, at work, in relationships. I became a shapeshifter—great at interviews, terrible at actually keeping a job. Friendly and energetic in public, but completely shut down and withdrawn once I got home.

Since my diagnosis, I’ve been learning about masking how we develop coping strategies to hide our symptoms and appear “normal.” And wow… it hit me like a truck. I didn’t even know who I *was* when I wasn’t performing.

I realized that I never sit down unless someone is watching me. I don’t rest unless I “earn” it. I still rehearse texts like I’m going into a job interview. Even with friends, I replay conversations in my head afterward to analyze if I talked too much or overshared.

But the moment that really broke me: I went on a weekend trip alone, and for the first time in a long time, I just… *existed*. No pressure. No pretending to be “on.” I cried in a museum for no reason. I wandered for hours. I left things unfinished without guilt. And I thought, “Oh. This is what it feels like to be me.”

I’m still figuring out who that person is without the mask. It's scary but freeing. If you're also going through this, I'd love to hear what helped you stay grounded through the process. I feel like I’m grieving a version of myself I never actually was.

Taking meds for this is the same as someone taking meds for a heart condition; it's maintenance for the mind.

I had it in my head for a long time that taking meds is a crutch  and it stopped me from getting the help I needed.

106wrzb,The 1% rule is working for me,DahliaHoliday,4455,2023-01-08 14:42:58,256,"I heard recently about the “1% rule” which is basically this: most of us think doing 1% of a task is worthless, and if we don’t do something 100% perfectly and to 100% completion, then it’s a waste of time and we shouldn’t even start. We are wrong. 

When you tell yourself that first 1% of a task IS EVERYTHING, it absolutely matters and it does make a difference, you don’t feel as intimidated by it, and completing that 1% of the project can spark the dopamine you need to finish the rest of the project.

I had put off cleaning my bathroom for months. I just couldn’t do it, the thought of it was so overwhelming. So I said “I will just wipe down this ONE area of the sink, it DOES make a difference, and I can do that ONE thing.” Once it was done, I said “OK, I can put these few bottles away, I can do that.” The pressure to clean the whole bathroom was off, I could walk away anytime. But next thing I knew, I was in “cleaning mode” and I knocked out the whole thing in an hour and my bathroom was sparkling. 

So next time you’re stuck, tell yourself “I can do this ONE thing, and it matters” and then fold one towel from the basket, wash one glass in the sink, sweep one corner of the kitchen, then try the next 1% of the task and see how you feel. You might surprise yourself.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/106wrzb/the_1_rule_is_working_for_me/,True,False

I need to rant about this because I am so angry how people who don't have and don't understand what ADHD is talk about it on tiktok. There was a video of Taylor swift holding her bag like any other normal person does and the comments were ""she's just like me fr, I'm so ADHD🤪"" or ""omg she is so AuDHD, she's one of us"". 

And don't get me started on people who say they have ADHD because they're so clumsy and they forgot where their keys were one time. Or the ones that forgot to make their bed one morning and suddenly they have ADHD. 

To have a neurological disorder like ADHD be talked about as if it's some cutesy, quirky thing that just makes you forget your keys or hold your bag in a certain way is frustrating. These people have no idea what it means to live with actual attention deficit, it distorts every aspect of your life.

13bcr9o,I’ve found the perfect ADHD-friendly career and I feel compelled to share,kittenxcaboodle,4415,2023-05-07 20:38:04,749,"(Disclaimer: I am not any sort of recruiter and gain nothing financial from this posting. I’m just trying to share my experience in hopes that it can help someone like me.)

I’m a 27yo female diagnosed with ADHD and started medication in 2021. I showed a ton of signs of ADHD as a child but was never diagnosed because I was good at masking/coping, but that’s a story for a different post.

I was previously a teacher and did some social work. I loved the job but like my symptoms were awful in that career because of the lack of daily closure and endless deadlines.

I will never stop talking about how perfect my career is for a brain like mine. And that career is radiologic technologist. If you don’t know what a rad tech is, they’re the people who take your x-rays, CTs, MRIs, and other medical imaging. 

Here’s why it’s perfect:

-All rad techs (except ultrasound) start in x-ray, which is what I do. When you get bored with x-ray, there are tons of opportunities to cross train in MRI, CT, IR, cath lab, vascular IR, mammography, and lots more. I love knowing that when I inevitably become tired of X-ray, I can easily change fields without having to change my place of work. And if I want to leave, I can work in a variety of environments.

-The instant gratification is incredible. There are no long term projects, no calendars full of deadlines, no long boring meetings. I x-ray a patient, get a small high when my images come out beautiful, I scan in like two papers, and then I send the patient on their merry way. If the patient is challenging, my brain is so happy to think outside the box and try different techniques to get things just perfect.

-The job is constantly on the go, which I LOVE! 

-School is only two years and is very hands on. I struggle with lectures so this worked very well for me.

-And best of all, no one judges me when I pound down my Ritalin with a Celsius because they’re all doing the same thing!

I really hope this helps somebody!☺️

EDIT: Wow, I did not anticipate to wake up with this much attention to this post! I wanted to answer a few commonly asked questions that I’m seeing over and over:

1. EDUCATION: A degree in X-ray which is where the majority of people start, is an Associate’s degree. I did the program in 20 months, which included a summer, and took most of my general education credits simultaneously. Several people in my graduating class did the program in three years so their gen eds were done ahead of time. There are Bachelors degrees but they’re not required. Some schools also offer 2+1 programs where you can graduate having done X-ray plus a modality. These are cool if you want to fast track yourself into a modality such as MRI or CT! While some modalities require a formal education, where I live most places will train the ones that don’t right on the job. I encourage those interested in a specific area to go to ARRT.org

2. THE SCHOOLING IS NO JOKE: Although school is short, it’s not for the faint of heart. You do clinicals along with didactic courses, and then at the end, you have to take and pass a massive board exam to get a license. The time those things take are a big commitment. I was really passionate about it all so it wasn’t as hard for me as it was for others!

3. SCHOOLING CAN BE FREE: I didn’t pay a penny to go back to school because I applied for every scholarship and every grant my community college offered. Hospitals need imaging professionals now more than ever so I know many hospitals are sponsoring students to go or offering massive amounts loan forgiveness.

4. PAY: I have a hard time answering questions about pay because it is so variable depending on if you work in a hospital or outpatient setting, if you take call, if you work a shift with high premiums, etc. Most of all, it totally depend on what state you’re in! X-ray techs generally are paid the lowest, but if you can work somewhere that cross trains in other modalities, you can make a lot more. My MRI friends have base pays higher than the staff nurses at the hospital. 

5. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TOUGH STOMACH: We see just as much as nurses/doctors if not more. Although I don’t generally have to clean patients, I do see open wounds and all of the bodily fluids. You also have to go to the OR during your schooling but you can find jobs that don’t require you to go to the OR. I have many friends in outpatient and they don’t deal with like any bodily fluids or super gross and sickly patients, but you do have to rotate through hospitals during school.

6. AN ABILITY TO DISASSOCIATE IS A MUST: I have a very high level of empathy like many of us ADHDers do. At first, it was hard. A patient comes in for a scan worried their cancer has returned, and you do the scan and see that it has. We don’t diagnose so we can’t tell the patient, we just have to smile and go back in and talk to the patient. When I started, this sucked. But I direct my empathy towards taking care of their immediate needs like getting them a warm blanket or being a listening ear, and don’t really focus on the bad stuff. It happens to every healthcare worker with time. Every once in a while I get a sweet patient with a horrible prognosis and after they leave, I shed a few tears, I’m human. But I am always satisfied that in my short time with them, I helped them feel more comfortable and heard and cared for, and that’s all that matters.

7. IM IN THE UNITED STATES: Other countries require more education. Like nursing though, the US has radiology travelers too! They make really good money and generally only need a year of experience!

8. WORK/LIFE BALANCE AND STRESS: I left teaching because of how unhealthy my work/life balance was. I love my job now because I clock in, do my job, and leave. The only thing I ever have to do outside of work is continuing education credits to maintain my license, which are not hard or very tedious and are only required every other year. The job can be stressful day in and day out if it’s busy or there are hard patients, but that stress is very short term. I clock out and forget about it, and the next day is a new day!!

Yeah, but do you procrastinate...

**Taking off your sweater**, even though it’s 90 degrees, because you’ll take it off right after you finish reading this article, and the article that was linked, oh and a video example on YouTube. 

**Getting off your phone** because your appointment is at 11, and you still have 10 minutes before you need to leave, oh and you planned to leave early so worst case you can leave a little later. 

**Sitting down to eat dinner** because you just remember that you bought a new shirt that you wanted to take a picture of to send to your group chat. 

**Getting out of bed** because that means you’ll have to start getting ready for work which consists of way too many steps and you didn’t plan what you were going to take for lunch so you might as well think of that while you are in your comfy bed.

**Getting out of your hot car**, because you really really need to look something up and you’ve been waiting to look it up this whole drive and also you need to see if you have any notifications, or maybe your boss got back to your email, and you really really like the song that’s playing. 

**Getting off of the couch** for no other reason than you are oscillating between interviewing yourself and going through an intense zone out session. 

Oh and finally one that’s more relatable... Do you procrastinate **doing your homework**? You’ll start it tonight after dinner, right? But after dinner, your tired and it’s technically not due until tomorrow morning, so you really have time if you wake up early. 

And so you wake up early, but you procrastinate it a little longer because before you start you have to calculate how many points you can lose to still pass the class. Because maybe you can get out of doing this assignment and go back to bed.

18x6adp,I accidentally hired a carer...,Cheeserole,4372,2024-01-02 17:12:18,212,"... instead of a cleaner, because the business was called ""Helping Hands"" and it was just across the road where I was shopping and I walked in and asked if they cleaned and they said yes and I somehow didn't notice all the brochures of old people about the place. 

It was supposed to just be a single deep clean to get my place up to par for a party, but they would've added a surcharge for one-offs since they usually only do regular scheduling. But they assured me I could cancel anytime, and I figured, *sure, I'll cancel after my party,* and that was two months ago. 

Anyway it turns out it's one of the best ADHD-taxes I've ever committed!!

The first person was really efficient but judgemental (since I'm obviously not a disabled senior citizen), but thanks to some rescheduling, I have someone who not only is similar to my age but is also from my culture! As a social worker who's been studying clinical psychology on the side, she's actually super understanding of my executive dysfunction and treats me like a real person instead of a failure like I expected and that's,,, really nice.

Okay. So. 

I hate the feel of lotion. It's greasy, and it's heavy, and I don't like putting it on because I feel...*wet* afterward. Putting on clothes after feels gross. 

I saw this in-shower body lotion at the store and thought ""what the hell."" Figured it'd be sensory torture like the others. So I put it on in the shower after I'd washed my body, rinsed it off, and then toweled off like normal.

w66aac,I might have saved my niece from sharing my fate last night,None,4347,2022-07-23 08:12:51,167,"At a family dinner last night, I was listening to my older sister-in-law asking my mom about how to deal with my niece’s studying problems and what my mom would do in the situation. I eavesdropped for long enough to realize that she was JUST describing ADHD. It’s a pretty safe call considering 4 of my 5 siblings are diagnosed and she’s shown every sign of it since she was born.

Anyways my niece is 9, she tested in the 97th-99th percentile last year depending on the subject, and my sister-in-law was lamenting how she doesn’t always put in her “best effort” when it comes to things like spelling homework. I had the exact same thing and my parents managed to entirely destroy my confidence by always criticizing that my low 90s on tests wasn’t “good enough” because I “could do better if I was trying my best”.

So I of course invited myself to the conversation and hopefully some stuff stuck. Big piece of advice was: Get her diagnosed. Then don’t be afraid of either therapy or medication because it’s better to have her develop correctly with it than struggle without because of stereotypes.

I laid out some basic tips like assigning daily tasks that she’s expected to finish and then not checking in through the day to make sure she’s working on it but rather praise her when she does it before last minute and only mention it if it DOESN’T get done, make the goal in studying for a specific amount time rather about completing it to a specific criteria so she can learn HOW to regulate herself for effective work instead of focusing on how much she gets done, and things like that.

BUT what I really tried to hammer in that I think stuck was: Nothing she learns in elementary school is more important than her development. The big things to watch out for are making sure she’s not being ostracized for talking to loud/too often/or talking over her friends constantly, making sure she grows up confident knowing that it’s ok to fail and to pick yourself up when you do, and learning just basic discipline in structure so she knows HOW to regulate herself to finishing tasks but also just making her bed and putting laundry away without the additional stress of “if i don’t do this, i will be in trouble.”

I’m really hoping I caught this at the right time and my siblings take it to heart so she doesn’t become the broken shell of a girl that I’ve spent so many years of therapy trying not to be.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/w66aac/i_might_have_saved_my_niece_from_sharing_my_fate/,True,False

&#x200B;

She told me she always takes time to explain and then said: “If I have to advocate for my job and the importance of it and the effects ADHD has on someone’s life, I cannot imagine how hard it can be for you, for others who have ADHD. I am fighting a stigma that is my job, but it’s not my life. This stigma is not okay. My heart goes out to you and to all people who have ADHD.”

o2pzmm,I have realized that environment plays a HUGE roll in my ADHD severity. Working on a farm is the PERFECT job for my ADHD brain. Who woulda thought.,asianstyleicecream,4264,2021-06-18 07:10:58,285,"So I started interning on a farm a few weeks ago. 

Before that, I had been unemployed for a few years (due to mental health & lack of decisive direction) though I always had a side hustle selling online, so I always had at least a small source of income. But I digress.

Since starting on this farm, my ADHD symptoms (mainly forgetfulness & inability to focus on what I have to do) have lessened in severity immensely. 

Not sure if it’s due to the lack of overstimulation (at home, I live on a busy street and I’m a highly sensitive person to begin with, so I get overwhelmed very easily by noises and movement, but at this farm it’s 10 acres of land where you don’t hear any [car] noises or other distractions, so it’s easier to focus), or if it’s the lack of burnout because every day is different. Because for me, with anything I do, I burn out easily because it becomes to repetitive & ‘boring’ for my brain, so I become less focused on it by the day. 

But here on a farm, you do something different every day. You’re not as rushed, you don’t have to check in and leave at a certain time (I’m living here on the farm), and they show you how to do everything so you understand it visually instead of just verbally. It’s honestly so perfect.

I’m also someone who prefers to work with their hands instead of their head. Probably because I could never rely fully on my brain remembering the correct things, and have always been a natural hard worker (always helping with building & repairing things around the house growing up). And i guess you could say my brain is pretty decent at coming up with ideas/solutions on a whim. So working on a farm is like the perfect environment for my type of brain. 

Just thought I should share in case someone else was struggling with not knowing if it’s their environment worsening their ADHD symptoms. Like I honestly have felt so much more confident in my self since these few weeks of being here, which I have never felt confident in myself, like ever.

In my country the diagnosis is made by psychiatrists and the medication is handled by them too, so I focused on how to tell apart people with anxiety from people with adhd from people with adhd and anxiety, how the classic symptoms and the DSM-V criteria are good enough for children but for adults deeper understanding is needed, I told them about executive functions, working memory, time blindness, (crap I forgot to tell them about motivation!) mind wandering...

In the end I had to rush and make a couple parts quicker because it was suposed to be 20 min and I think maybe it was more like 30 by the end...

ojn4ij,I'm so fucking sick of having ADHD,eiksnaglesn,4236,2021-07-13 12:36:21,361," I’m sick of working twice as hard and getting half as far, 

I’m sick of forgetting everything I learn, 

I’m sick of the constant exhausting mental monologue I can’t shut up,

I’m sick of battling myself, 

I’m sick of having the logical maturity of a 24 year old but the emotional maturity of a toddler,  

I’m sick of drowning in emotions, 

I’m sick of repressing those emotions cause I never learned how to handle them, 

I'm sick of my anger and my sadness and my boredom and my desperation,

I’m sick of feeling like my mind doesn’t belong to me, 

I feel like the tiny part of my mind I still feel is “me” just has to work full time as a prison guard keeping the rest of me in check, 

I'm sick of being fucked over by the healthcare system over and over again,

I'm sick of their stupid empty words they put up like a movie set facade to keep people from seeing the chaos and neglect happening behind,

I'm sick of just being a statistic to them while my life and wellbeing depends on them and will for the rest of my life,

I'm sick of disappointing others,

I'm sick of disappointing myself,

That's the worst part I think, that at the end of the day my life and my actions are still my responsibility and blaming ADHD won't change that. My emotions are mine, my actions are mine, my failures are mine, I can't separate myself from them no matter how much I hate them. I'm so fucking sick of having ADHD. Controlling my chaotic emotions and living every day with a mind that refuses to cooperate is wearing me down to a fucking shell of a human being. 

My meds help but they don't take away the bad, they just make me a little bit stronger against it but I'm so exhausted of keeping it under control and feeling like there's always a huge flood of anger, bitterness, spite, sadness and self hatred dammed up inside my brain that I can't ever lose control of and I can't get rid of even if I want to. 

Sorry for the long rant, I'm feeling extra defeated today.

Then something happened and I’ve spent every day ever since doing nothing outside of work. I have bipolar and adhd so I’m probably just in a slump but I hate it. 

For a while I’ve been jealous of my boyfriend’s job. He makes less than I do and is also entry level but his job has given him more things to learn and do. He only goes in fo an average of 4 hours each day. He comes home and at like 9pm opens up his lap top and starts doing Linux classes. I inspired him to learn Linux and Python right before the pandemic and he has quickly surpassed me. I’m just jealous of the time and energy he has to get a better job. 

I’m expected to be on for 8 hours every day doing repetitive monotonous data work. He has been giving more varied learning projects for work so it’s invigorating. My mind is dead after work and I feel like I can’t do anything. It’s that and my Adderall wears off by a certain time.

During this time, I was able to manage a 2.0-3.5 GPA but **my social life was tumultuous and frightening**. I **lost a lot of trust in those around me** because I thought they **just didn't care as much as I did**, or because **I thought I hadn't done anything to deserve the treatment I received**. 

I only wish the aloof, lost-puppy-looking stereotype of ADHD **also included the inability to regulate emotions**, as I think that's one part of ADHD that is **known to some but not most**. It's also a piece that **can be misinterpreted by outsiders as a short temper, or a weak spine, or wearing your heart on your sleeve.** I wish that, one day, non-ADHD folks **could recognize emotional dysregulation alongside loss of focus as symptoms of ADHD and not a lazy, emotional slob**. Maybe it's just me projecting my insecurities, but it feels like the combination of symptoms is often **mistaken for willful lazy assholery.** 

Now that medication is helping me with the focus part, the next step(and the harder part imo) is **learning to identify when my emotions are beginning to control themselves** and **how to co-exist with them**.

Where I live, ADHD medication is highly regulated. I have to schedule an appointment every month with my doctor, to which I take a drug test **monthly**. I've been taking this medication for SEVEN years. To give you an idea, that is 84 drug tests in total I have taken just to get my medication.

Every month, I run out of my medication and have about 2-3 days where I have to wait, unmedicated, to schedule and go to an appointment with my Physician. With my work schedule, there is no telling when I'll be needed, so scheduling ahead of time is out of the question. Can I work without it? Sure. Would I still be employed at my job without it? Absolutely not. Most employers don't acknowledge ADHD to the same level as other ADA qualified disabilities. 

The biggest issue (out of many) I've had with my ADHD has always boiled down to energy.  If I were to explain how ADHD works to those without it, I would say it's like you took Melatonin as soon as you wake up in the morning...and you **kept on taking it** throughout the day. You could imagine it would be hard enough to stay awake, let alone do anything productive. Now imagine you do that **every day for the rest of your life**.

1m9wbks,Why I stopped saying “I have ADHD”,LarryFarnsworth,4203,2025-07-26 08:35:29,420,"For the longest time, I’ve wanted to tell people that I have ADHD, especially when I screw something up or act in a way that seems “off.” But saying “Sorry, I have ADHD” never felt quite right. It usually lands wrong, like I’m making excuses, or the other person doesn’t really know how to respond.

Lately though, I’ve started doing something that feels better: instead of naming the diagnosis, I’ll just say something specific about how my brain works. Like, “Sorry, I’m really distractible,” or “That’s on me, I have a terrible memory.”

There’s something about narrowing it down to the behavior – attention, memory, time – that feels easier for other people to understand, and honestly, easier for me to say. It’s less loaded. Less clinical. If someone wants to connect the dots to ADHD, that’s their call. But I’m not putting that label in their hands.

jg28rc,"Do you ever feel like you are an adult that needs a ""babysitter"" all the time otherwise if someone isn't there to make you do things, help you do things, you'll never get much done?",tanveerhasADD,4187,2020-10-22 08:53:49,346,"I (31F) accidentally hired a babysitter for myself for a couple hours a day for the past couple weeks because my husband was looking for someone to come and help with chores. He has OCPD and needs things to be meticulously organized before he can function at his demanding new job. We both work from home since the start of the pandemic so initially I had volunteered to just do the chores and for him to pay me instead. However this arrangement never worked because the entire pandemic I couldn't be consistent with it and just let things go to disarray (of course) before I did anything. If there were 10 things on a list to do daily I'll do 2-3 and feel very productive. So in the end he was doing the rest of the tasks on the chores list (doesn't help I thought they were ridiculous in the first place).

So he went online to find a cleaner to come everyday for an hour or two to help with the chores. I initially protested to this because to me ""we didn't need it"". So the past couple weeks we have a girl come everyday. Now I protested because I don't like to sit around while someone else is cleaning up after me when I feel like I can do it myself (on my own time and very inconsistently), so I've been just telling her to just assist me with the tasks. So she's been babysitting me for 1-2 hours everyday and I've never been so productive.

House? Sparkling clean. Bed? Made every morning. Groceries? Done and put away in the pantry and fridge immediately. Dishes & utensils? Unloaded from the dishwasher and stowed away into the cupboards. Laundry? Done and folded immediately. Cats? Happy that we are less stressed out and aren't fighting all the time. We've also managed to cut down on food delivery because I now have the energy and enthusiasm to cook. 

I always thought that perhaps I didn't do much because I had no motivation, energy, or time. But it turns out I needed someone else (not my husband) to push me the right way to do things on my own and help when I can't. At my job I still struggle because I'm alone and I dictate what I do with my time (eg won't get much done until the last minute) and don't have anyone to work everyday alongside with.

Since hiring the ""adultsitter"", I have so much more motivation to pursue weird new hobbies (I want to take up bushcraft so I can pretend I'm a hunter gatherer at least for a few hours). I realized being an adult with ADHD in our society can be very lonely, because we are expected to be able to do things on our own, when really humans evolved to be social creatures. If you can afford to get someone to watch you or even just accompany you to errands you absolutely hate/feel anxious about, get that adultsitter! It also satisfies my innate desire to be able to do things ""on our own"" since I still put in effort to do the tasks. If you've got a friend or accountability buddy who has time to sit around while you do your stuff, get them to sit around and adultsit you!",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/jg28rc/do_you_ever_feel_like_you_are_an_adult_that_needs/,True,False

uqyrha,"The ""roomba"" method of cleaning",TopRamen713,4165,2022-05-16 08:38:16,515,"I've finally discovered a way to clean that works for me. First, caffeinate heavily. Second, put on headphones and a bunch of podcasts. Third, start cleaning and putting shit away. Doesn't matter where. When you come across something that needs to be put away in a different room, go to that room, put it away and start cleaning that room until you find something that needs to be put in a different room again. Rinse and repeat.

This has two major advantages for me. First, I clean everything relatively equally instead of just deep cleaning and getting stuck in one area. Second, I'm constantly moving, which keeps things interesting for me.

Anyone else have tips for cleaning?",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/uqyrha/the_roomba_method_of_cleaning/,True,False

So backstory, I've had ADHD my entire life it feels like. I got my first diagnosis when I was 7 years old, and have been on and off meds for years. That's been my own battle of deciding whether or not I chose to believe I had a disorder. I tried to get ahead of it in college, and got treatment about 8 years ago, but I haven't been on anything for about 7 years now. I've been just getting along with the coping mechanisms I've developed over the years, but now with the encouragement of my SO I decided to actually start making a real effort to treat it. I talked to my doctor about getting back on a medication, but she said she can't do that, I need to go see a psychiatrist.

That's cool, I don't mind seeing another doctor, but I've called THREE different psychiatry offices now, and first off nobody answers the phone. You just get a lengthy voicemail asking you to leave a message (which I do) and then they never call you back. That's the most ANNOYING shit I've run into so far is just how damn hard it is to actually find help. Not to mention, this has been a 3 month process now, because I have such a garbage memory, that 3 weeks will go by before I think about the fact that nobody has called be back. I'm starting to just feel completely helpless about the whole thing.  Like I end up feeling like ""I've managed to make it 32 years on this earth without really treating it, so why bother at this point."" My SO tells me I need to be persistent, and I know that I need to keep trying and keep seeking help, but it doesn't make it any less frustrating.

EDIT: Wow, I was just planning for this to be a shout into the void of the internet, but it sure blew up. Thank you guys for all the support, I will keep trying to get help.

EDIT 2: I'm trying to read everyone's comments, but this has been insane how much support and how cool it is hearing everyone's story and experiences. It gives me hope.

tl3mrr,I just got a six figures job!,jujubadetrigo,4143,2022-03-23 10:43:08,256,"Since things are still kinda being finalized at the moment, I can't talk about this with a lot of people in my life but I'm kinda bursting with excitement, so I wanted to share this happiness with you guys. I just got a an awesome job offer with a six figures salary! 

That is amazing to me because between 2017 and 2019 I didn't work or study at all because of what I later discovered was depression and anxiety stemming from undiagnosed adhd. Basically, my undiagnosed adhd wrecked my life. I dropped out of college multiple times (still haven't graduated), couldn't hold down a job and struggled a lot with everyday things. My parents initially were very against psychological treatment though, so I just kept pushing, thinking if only I tried harder I would be able to get it together. 

Well, I didn't. Which led to this period of crisis between 2017 and 2019 when things got really bad and I was basically suicidal. I thought I had messed up my academic/professional life to a point of no return and that if I got a job at a starbucks or something, I should consider myself lucky.

Things only started changing when a friend basically staged an intervention and strongly suggested to my parents that they should invest in psychological treatment for me. I then eventually got diagnosed with ADHD and when I started taking meds everything suddenly got **a lot** easier for me.

Of course, undoing the mess I had made of my life wasn't instant, but in 2019 I started working again, first as a receptionist at a doctor's office. It was an awful job, so tiring because I had to interact with so many people and also speak on the phone a lot, which I hate. But it got me out of the house and the fact that I hated the job so much made me start thinking about alternatives.

Coding had always been something in the back of my mind because I liked doing websites when I was a teenager, but I only knew very basic stuff. I then started studying it, first on my own and then later at a bootcamp and then in 2021 I finally got a job as a software developer.  I live in South America but as you guys can see, I do speak english pretty well so my plan was always to stay a year at this job at a local company and after I had some experience, to search for a job that paid in dollars or in euros, since that would give me the ability to basically live anywhere in the world. 

And today I finally got that offer from an American company! It's so crazy to me because a few years ago I really thought that my life was over and I would basically be a drain on my family for the rest of my life since I didn't seem to be able to function and now, here I am! So if you're still in that rough part of your life, please don't give up!

1ji7lnb,PSA: Neurologists are the secret homies for treating ADHD,None,4151,2025-03-23 12:34:04,278,"My brief story: I was diagnosed as a teen (moderate to severe) given a script by my GP (Back when GP's would do this) and I stayed medicated until about for about a decade until my GP retired. New GP wouldn't prescribe and pushed me to psychiatrist, then I found out in my entire insurance medical network not a single psychiatrist was taking new adult ADHD patients. Lol

I then turned to telehealth. I got a script from Done. Done got shut down by the feds because they were giving them to anyone I guess. Switched to a different tele health. The tele health refused to prescribe Vyvanse and only would prescribe nonstimulants which didn't work.

Then I tried going to an out-of-pocket cash only psychiatrist place. They made me schedule 2 appts in 2 weeks to get ""re-evaluated"" I ended up missing one of the re-evaluations and of course they kicked me out and wouldn't let me go any further or even reschedule because ""Strict no-show policy sorry"" at this point, I literally gave up

Then I ended up getting referred to the neurologist for migraines. At the appointment he asked me about my health history and I literally just said ""oh yeah I have ADHD,"" and he said, ""oh, you have ADHD? what have you taken in the past that worked"" after a brief conversation of my medical and medication history he ended up writing me a script without any bullshit. No stupid hoops to jump through, no waiting lists, no bullshit....just someone who wanted to actually see me treated.

- Running through/playing out/practicing conversations or social interactions in your head or out loud to yourself prior to the actual interaction.

- Doing things at the last minute and still getting a good grade/score/or positive feedback but unable to feel you deserve it because you know you didn’t spend much time/waited til the night before. 

-Hyperfocusing on interactions after the fact playing them out in your mind trying to evaluate how it went and how you were perceived. 

- Really good at coming up with metaphors/analogies.  

- Feeling frozen until it’s time to leave for work/an appointment/social meeting out of fear you’ll get hyperfocused on the activity losing track of time making you late/forget where you need to be. 

- Over explaining yourself bc you have a fear of being misunderstood.  

- Trouble maintaining long distance friendships you actually really care about.


*****Posted in comments but adding it here as well*****

Very overwhelmed by the response! Many of you have asked or brought up talking points that I have responded to within other comments earlier in the thread. Read through! I’ve addressed the idea of diagnosis/dsm, put a link to an article on an adhd creativity study, and discussed that these are not “symptoms” nor should be pathologized just common things/struggles I see in my adhd clients that do not occur in my non-adhd clients. Many fixate on the idea of symptoms and clearly defining diagnoses but it’s not that simple or clear cut. Humans are complex and nuanced. Multiple things can and do exist at the same time. Your experience is yours and your unique struggles are valid. Diagnosis/the dsm is really just short hand to cluster/define symptoms to communicate with other professionals and insurance companies by the numbers associated with said diagnosis. Diagnosis is fluid and can change over time as new information is known/articulated. ADHD is about brain function/formation so it is helpful to know and understand so you can better articulate your needs in the world.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/xnrvxq/adhd_things_not_in_dsm_from_a_therapist_with_adhd/,True,False

ifsln9,Let’s share life-changing ADHD tips that we’ve learned...,lexid222,4119,2020-08-24 09:44:13,772,"I’ll start:

1) Waking up sucks. Buy 2 bright lamps and 2 timers. Set them up to turn on automatically 5-15 min before you want your alarm to go off. The lights will help your body realize it’s daytime.

2) Change your thermostat so the temp goes down about an hr before bedtime and gets warmer about 30 min before you wake up. The cooler temp signals your body to sleep and the warmer temp will naturally help your body wake up.

3) Learn to plan around “transitions”. It’s easier to start things if you do them when something is ending. Example: Do your grocery shopping every Fri after work. You’re already in the car, so just stop at the store on your way home. 

4) If you need to remember to bring something with you the next day, place it right in front of the exit door so you HAVE to touch it before you leave the house. If it’s something in the fridge, put a sticky note on the exit door’s handle.

5) Have a “misc” basket in each room. If you’re truly unable to put something away, put it in the basket. Have a designated period of time, once a week, when your sole priority is to put everything away, all at once.

They're often not. There are almost 1.25 million subscribers to this sub-reddit. Ten, twenty, or even one hundred people here affirming your experience does not mean that the experience is symptomatic of your shared condition.

Out of 1.25 million people with the condition, you will get an intersection of many other conditions, identities, personalities, etc. Because of its sheer volume, there will be thousands of people in this sub that relate to any post, many of whom would regardless of if they had ADHD or not. If you ask ""DAE do X thing"" and X thing happens to be typical of Y condition, you are going to receive many responses from the thousands of people with Y condition that also happen to have ADHD.

For anyone curious, you can get more info on earning admission to ASU [here](http://ea.asu.edu).
Idk if there are similar programs at other schools, but for those in similar situations to mine, there ARE options for you out there to get back in school and succeed! It's never too late!


Tl;Dr: Did poorly in HS, failed out of college the first time around. Got into ASU through Earned Admission program with a 4.0, on my way to being an engineer!

So, like many here, I always struggled through school as a kid. I voluntarily stopped taking my meds in 9th grade because of all the stigma surrounding Adderall and ADHD in general. I was confused and just wanted to feel like myself and have fun. (Yes, my teenage rebellion was getting *off* drugs lol)

I barely squeaked by and graduated, took a gap semester (still had no idea what I wanted to do with my life at that point) and then started college. English major.
I fucked off, skipped classes, slept through them, and got put on academic probation after 2 semesters. Didn't clean up my act in semester 3, so I got the boot.

Fast forward to 2016, when I finally started to take my ADHD seriously again and got medicated. I've been on Straterra, done a lot of research (and lurking in this sub), and been managing my symptoms really well. 

In late 2019 I decided I wanted to finally go back to college and get a degree in Electrical Engineering. I'm active duty Air Force, so I researched the best online degree programs and found that Arizona State was the best option for me. Applied, and was promptly rejected. No surprise, really, since I did *horribly* in school in the past. 
But then the advisor told me about their Earned Admission program. Finish 4 of their classes with a 2.75 GPA or better and you're in. My HS GPA was 2.3 and college was so dismal I think I blocked that number from memory.

Anyway, I started that program last year, right before Covid. Here I am a year later, having just finished the program with a 4.0 GPA.

Guys, I just can't even describe how proud of myself I am. I'm fucking ecstatic! I *NEVER* thought I'd be able to get a degree after I got kicked out of college in my 20s. Now I've proved to myself that not only can I do well in school, but I can maintain a 4.0!
Now I will be an officially enrolled student there, and can begin my path toward my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering (Bring on the calculus!!)

You can't get started on something because your brain's going a mile a minute, and the thought of having to discipline your thinking produces a wave of dread that can quickly overwhelm you. I get it; it's a regular thing for me, and probably for most people on this thread.

But less attention is paid (no pun intended) to the long-term paralysis that can result from ADHD: when you're unable to plan for the future because your interests are in a constant state of flux. In order to make progress we need to commit to goals, and in order to commit to goals we need a baseline level of emotional stability ... but ADHD can remove that stability. It can make you feel like disaster is perpetually imminent, so your struggle to avert disaster becomes the only objective you have time for.

Over time this can really knock your self-confidence. The irony of having ADHD is that I'm open-minded but incredibly short-sighted. I take things one week at a time, and my primary objective at any given moment is simply to 'keep it together'.

*Fluff*

This has been a huge help for me. I'm sure we can all agree that ADHD diagnosis and treatment is not very ADHD friendly! The controlled nature of the drugs due to the abuse by neurotypicals makes it hard to manage. The fact I have to get a new scrip signed off every month instead of a standing repeat prescription like most other meds actively gets in the way of treatment. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who's ever ran out of meds, and the resulting lack of motivation etc. without treatment lead to an awful feedback loop that made it harder to actually go and get the meds to fix the problem!

*Actual Content*

So for me, I get my little bottle every 28 days. I take out 7 days worth, move them to last months bottle, and put that to the side. In 21 days, I'll empty my new bottle. On the day I do that, I'll contact my GP/Pharmacy and ask for my next prescription to be filled. The physical act of having to get the other bottle is my reminder that I'm almost out and to get more. That way, I still have 7 days of meds to last while my next prescription is filled.

I haven't once missed a dose since I discovered this, I hope it helps some of you out!

o3a3nd,The two states of an ADHD relationship: obsessing over someone OR forgetting they exist,FaithInStrangers94,3996,2021-06-18 23:48:20,254,"It seems that ADHD leaves me with two modes of operating when it comes to relationships; hyperfixation and obsession over someone - giving them the keys to the kingdom of your mind so they can worm their way into almost every thought. Naturally this leads to some very off putting behaviour. 

Or an almost total lack of conscious thought until you realise you’ve gone weeks without contacting somebody you’re supposed to be friends with, perhaps even romantically entwined. 

Like the Morton’s fork dilemma this makes it near impossible to hold down healthy relationships because the other party either feels smothered or forgotten, or constantly crushed between the two extremes.

While I'm happy to see others feel much needed relief from the debilitating symptoms of ADHD, I also think it's important to have realistic expectations of medication. The first week, it's possible you're experiencing euphoria as a side effect of the medication. After all, it's thrilling to be able to do the thing you've been putting off for ages. 

However, I do not believe non-ADHD people normally feel the way we do those first few days of taking medication. Things will level out and tasks still are difficult, especially after years of taking medication. That doesn't mean all hope is lost, not at all. What it does mean is that those first few months are critical to building structures that help your ADHD. Use the time you're feeling better on medication to build good habits.

there are so many things i could put here, but here are some of the highlights

the fact that i got scolded or screamed at what felt like nearly every day for yEARS

the fact that i struggled so badly for so long and absolutely no one took my concerns seriously

the fact that i was always the last person to finish any quiz/exam/standardized test, i always used all of the time i was given (i still think it’s strange that other people didn’t) and even then on several occasions i wasn’t able to finish even though i knew the material

the fact that i routinely had to have meetings with my teachers about those exams and i tried to explain to them that i knew all the answers, but i just ran out of time, and if i had some more time to work i could have finished, and getting an ‘aw that’s too bad’ in response

BUT even when i did finish, i ended up making ‘careless mistakes’ even after reading each question multiple times to make sure i knew what it was asking and checking every answer multiple times (this was especially true for math, and any time we were allowed to use a calculator, i had to do the simplest calculations (like 2+2) multiple times to make sure they were correct

the fact that other people could finish simple in class assignments in like 10 mins but i almost always had to take the work home to finish it, adding to my mountain of homework

the fact that i felt like i had to work so much harder as everyone else to get decent grades

the fact that all of the above and many other things have absolutely destroyed my self esteem and my sense of self

njhnus,Stop Glorifying ADHD: It's Not A Superpower or a Gift,deja_moon,3950,2021-05-23 14:23:16,424,"I can't stand the amount of misinformation about ADHD I've been seeing on TikTok and social media lately. It's great that social media is making people realize they might have ADHD however, there are a lot of things that people say about ADHD that are just wrong or downright harmful. The amount of people that are self-diagnosing because they can listen to a video and comprehend it at 2x speed is crazy.  Or self-diagnosing because they can speak quickly.  These people are literally describing it as a quirky cute disorder that impacts their life in a positive way to the extent of describing it as a superpower and glorifying the symptoms. 

I was just watching this pretty big YouTuber's most recent upload where she talks about being diagnosed with ADHD. She describes it as a superpower and she's anti-medication because she doesn't want to lose her ""sparkle"" I guess.  It just hurts to hear someone with such a big platform that I adore spreading misinformation/that mindset about something that has inhibited every aspect of so many people's lives. Especially people who have gone undiagnosed for such a long-time.  

In my own life, my ignorant parents who don't believe in disorders did not want me to go seek help (despite recognizing the symptoms of ADHD in me) and get a diagnosis because they believed in the same thing this YouTuber was saying. I've spent countless nights and days feeling defeated wondering why I couldn't just DO things like everyone else. 

ADHD has made so many people's lives so hard that if you do not get help for it, you can develop depression, anxiety, and a whole list of other issues which makes dealing with ADHD a lot more difficult.

Adhd for me isn't a super power. Especially when I went undiagnosed, it has ruined my life, everything was ruined because of all the symptoms I have that went unnoticed. It made me not being able to pay attention in class and to get assignments done on time, It left me not being able to go to university at the same time as everyone else despite really wanting to, it left me not being able to keep a job for more than 1 or 5 months at a time, it left me not being able to clean my room despite having mold growing on food and dishes. It also left me impulsively buy things and only to forget about them the next day, or binge eating food until I want to vomit and binge drinking alcohol to the point where I could potentially die, all because I confuse my boredom for extreme sadness, anger issues so debilitating that it has ruined my relationship with my mother due to emotional dysregulation. It made me not being able to keep up with basic hygiene because I would lose time and I wouldn't realise a week has gone by. It made me buy new underwear and wear the same dirty  clothes because I found it too difficult to even pick up my dirty laundry and to throw them into the washing machine even though it's such a simple task. 

Yeah I'm funny, outgoing and creative and I can learn easily especially when the task is hands on and I'm able to hyper focus under extreme pressure to the point where I can keep up with being timed on tasks at work.

I was extremely excited for this appointment given how hard it has been for me and finally feeling hopeful for some change. 

Well. Let me tell you. The entire experience was horrendous. She told me that stimulants weren’t going to magically make me want to start doing things, and that if I didn’t have a solid plan about how I was going to start holding myself more accountable, then she wasn’t going to treat me with stimulants. So you’re telling me that this whole time I just haven’t been coming up with solid plans to hold myself accountable? Wow, I didn’t know it was so simple. Im so sick of coping mechanisms. I can make list and keep a calendar all day, but there are still so many issues to be addressed that medicine would help. 

She asked me so many questions about why I didn’t feel like I was able to accomplish certain task, and when I told her my answers she continued to make me feel like the biggest idiot. I wanted to disconnect from the call right then and there. My head was spinning. 

She ended the appointment by asking me about my sex life. I told her I’m currently sleeping with one person. She asked if I was on birth control. I am not. I hate birth control. I’ve never had a good experience. Don’t really feel like I have to explain that to anyone. It’s my body. She told me that before my next appointment I have to talk to my partner about pregnancy, and that stimulants are not a good enough reason for terminating a pregnancy. 

She said she believes that I have ADHD, but she said she didn’t feel comfortable prescribing me anything until then. She was about to not even prescribe my usual SSRI. I’ve just never had an experience like this ever. Just wow.

Here is a snippet of an interview with the two writer/directors:

>Dan Kwan: When we first started writing this movie, we knew we wanted to make a movie about chaos and about this overwhelming feeling that everyone's been feeling the past six years. Or 34 years. Or all throughout history of mankind. But when we started writing, we were like, ""Oh, we should probably do a little bit of research about ADHD. Maybe the main character is undiagnosed and they don't know it.""  
>  
>Daniel Scheinert: Yeah, we were like, ""Maybe she's so distractible, she can go to other universes with her brain."" But then we're like, ""That might be offensive. We should Google it.""  
>  
>Kwan: So I started doing some research. And then I stayed up until like, four in the morning, just reading everything I could find about it, just crying, just realizing that, ""Oh, my God, I think I have ADHD."" So this movie is the reason why I got diagnosed.

It's not just about ADHD, it's about all kinds of things like also generational trauma and nihilism and... like, everything. But I've never really seen a movie capture the feeling of being ADHD like this, it's ridiculous.

And I love where it *goes* with that.

I don't wanna spoil anything so I won't get into details, but lemme just say - the last line of the movie spoke to me very deeply and I cried. A lot.

It was the most thoughtful thing an SO had ever done for me. 

As most of you can probably imagine, I’m quite used to people being bothered by my ADHD-related traits. I feel like that is the main reason people dont want to invest in me and leave/neglect the relationship. They don’t (care to?) understand its groundworks and implications. I cant blame them, I dont even really do that myself.. I just live it..

But her? She doesnt just brush off my ADHD-traits as a nuisance which she ‘has to deal with’. She’s fascinated by it; she wants to understand. On top of that, she, herself, is extremely structured and organised, which makes it even more special that she doesnt think any less of me for my ADHD. There’s not the slightest hint of any “how hard can it be”-stances. It seems she truly loves me regardless. 

I dont have to hide or be ashamed of anything ADHD in this relationship. And it brings me so much closer to accepting and being okay with my ‘flaws’.

This leads to large amounts of rotted vegetables, cold coffee, and having JUST run out of this thing i really need right now.

To combat this I set myself booby traps.   For example if I happen to notice that my shampoo is running low, I'll set the bottle in the middle of the bathroom floor so that once I'm dressed and ready for my day I will quite literally trip over it, thus reminding me I need to order more.  I often move foods in front of beverages in the fridge so that I have to interact with them, reminding me that I bought Jicama for a reason! Or I will set my meds at an odd angle to remind myself I haven't taken them yet. My house is chock full of items in odd places to help jog my memory along.

> Object permanence involves understanding that items and people still exist even when you can't see or hear them. This concept was discovered by child psychologist Jean Piaget and is an important milestone in a baby's brain development.

Did you forget about calling your friend back because you didn't realize they still existed, simply because you couldn't see them anymore? Hell no. Only babies don't have object permanence (which is why you can play ""peekaboo!"" with them) and then they grow out of it at a certain age.

We can have problems *remembering* things because of distractions and whatnot, but memory issues and object permanence aren't the same thing. We might forget about something but we haven't come to the conclusion that it has ceased to exist because it's left our line of sight.

Not the thing she was supposed to do, something else. And what does her father do? He gets thrilled too, letting her show her accomplishment in detail, hearing her out and discussing how to improve for a couple of minutes. THEN he asked her about the original task, telling her that he can understand she forgot about it doing this, but it has to be done today. So he offers her to start together on it and come back to this thrilling thing afterwards. All in a sincere and loving tone. He's upstairs right now getting her started.

Back when I was going into my teens, I didn't really had the best dental hygiene. I improved it as I got older, and now brushing my teeth every morning is no problem. But looking back now after getting my diagnosis at 30 it makes sense why I always found the task so mentally monumental. And although it isn't outwardly noticeable, the early neglect did cause some damage, so I've always felt embarrassed about the subject of dental hygiene. Although brushing my teeth first thing in the morning is just part of my routine now, I still have always struggled with maintaining that same routine at night. 


But just recently I started taking Vyvanse, and guys, it's been working so well! The past week and a half I've been on top of so many things with no hesitation, and that includes actually brushing my teeth at night before bed!

After two weeks, the energy and focus sort of faded as I settled into the medication and I’ve been thinking it wasn’t doing much and that I needed a dosage increase. Well, I was wrong because it’s definitely doing its job! 

Today I was in line at a sandwich shop when a person very rudely pushed past me and went straight to the counter. Now, there were only two people in line, me and an older lady waiting at the counter. This woman pushed past me and demanded the cashier’s attention as the older woman was waiting on her order. Generalized anxiety disorder runs in my family and I’ve always suffered from very strong anxiety, even as a child. I’ve never been able to reliably confront someone, even if they’ve wronged me. Today, I was finally able to say something! 

The convo went something like this: 

Me: “Excuse me, ma’am, I’m in line.”

Her: “Yeah, I see that. I’m here to pick something up.

M: “So am I, but, as you can see, there’s a line.” 

H: *stank face*

Maybe you're struggling to carry only 50 marbles, and you see people around you easily managing 150, which is bitterly discouraging.  But the fact that you can even hold on to that many is incredible BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A BAG, BUT YOU'RE STILL TRYING.

Medication is like having a bag with a hole in it.  It's so much better than what you're used to so when you start using it you feel on top of the world. Then you notice that marbles are slowly falling out and you think ""what's the point, it's just as bad as before."" But you have to remember it's still worth it.

The worst thing you can do is trip on the marbles you've dropped. That's my biggest struggle. I focus on one little thing I've messed up and all of a sudden I've come crashing down and drop all the marbles I was able to hold minutes before. 

I don't really know where I'm going with this but as soon as I thought of the analogy I hyperfixated on it (of course) and had to share it. Hopefully this helps you in some way, maybe as a way to explain ADHD to people who don't get it.

Edited to add: Not everyone wants/needs meds, and that's fine! The ""bag with a hole"" can represent whatever coping mechanism fits you best (eg therapy).

Before reading, just a heads up that this is creative writing that describes my feelings of imposter syndrome in the context of ADHD.**

I’m faking ADHD to get stimulant medication. 

The meds make me feel focused and alert. 

They make me feel confidant and happy. 

They make me feel like I have control over my mind. 

When I’m medicated, I can stay on task. I have been staying on top of my emails at work. I’ve been reading and drawing more. 

When I’m medicated, I can tell myself to do something that I’d normally avoid, and then I just get up and do it, without arguing with myself and procrastinating for hours or days.

When I’m medicated, I can listen to my husband talk about things and not space out and start thinking about groceries, or the cats, or work, or my outfit for tomorrow, or the feeling of the couch fabric on my hand, or how they get shipping containers off of boats and onto trucks, or how I need to book an appointment, or that dream I had last week. 

When I’m medicated, I don’t want to eat ice cream for every meal, I can tell myself not to get a cookie at Subway even though I really want one, I can make myself a healthy dinner and enjoy it. 

When I’m medicated, I can remember my plans for the day, even if I didn’t write them all down in my phone. 

When I’m medicated, I feel like life is a lot easier. Not perfect. But easier.

Even my doctor is fooled - on the phone yesterday he said “Yeah, based on your reaction to the medication, I’m going to officially diagnosis you with ADHD”.

…I might have been prescribed stimulant medication because I have ADHD…

**Edit: Obviously I’m not actually faking for meds. Just wanted to type this up to express how imposter syndrome can be so insidious and contrary to reality.**

**I flaired this post as success/celebration because I feel that 1. I’ve come a long way in being aware of how my brain can distort reality into insecurity, and 2. Because I’ve finally received my diagnosis and am getting the right treatment.**",0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/tz8uzn/im_faking_adhd_to_get_stimulant_medication/,True,False

Time blindness gives me so much anxiety.

I'm a graphic/motion designer so I often end up working with people who have no idea how I do my job. So they ask me how long something will take and I have no idea! I'm under pressure so I make up a time frame. If it's low then I've set myself up for failure, if it's high i see them blanch and think I must be shit at my job.

Then there's the occasions where they don't give me a deadline at all, but then complain and ask why something took 3 hours. I don't know? I was trying to think of good ideas for you and it takes time to make illustrations?

People always told me I'd get better at estimating the length of tasks with experience, but nah. I have absolutely no idea how neurotypicals even entertain the thought of accurate time estimation, never mind doing it successfully.

Mid conversation he paused and said to me: ""Let me know if I'm off base here, but **do you get a sense of pride when you pass as neurotypical?**""

That's something I've never really thought of before. There a difference between trying to fit into a system made for neurotypicals and trying to pass as one myself. I struggle with both; however, the second leads to it being hard to accept myself for who I am. 

I have ADHD, and no amount of ""passing"" will change that... so why do I keep trying to pretend I don't have it? Why do I make things needlessly difficult for myself by never asking for accommodations, or just help in general?

He asked to see it, and I brought out the bottle along with the bag that it came in from the pharmacy and the receipt and the prescription.

No one.

No one mentions how as you slowly get off (per help from your doctor) the first few weeks of each lowering dosage is full of lack of motivation, joy, and energy.

No one talks about how you realize your symptoms of ADHD are actually still there, and the little tips and tricks you learned over the years don't work as well with lower executive functioning.

No one talks about how the depression and anxiety you had before your diagnosis slowly creeps back in due to the constant reappearance of accidental self-sabotaging habits.

No one mentioned this part out of all the years I've been in the ADHD community, and I feel slightly bitter about it because SO many people are ADVOCATES for medication, but no one seems to mention this small reality for women wanting to start a family.

If you fall into this category, I want you to know that I wish I had known more about this part of the process. It is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT at times to handle, especially since I'm used to a certain flow that I can no longer keep up with.

Do I feel like this all the time? No. Are certain things better as I lower my medication? Yes.

But do I constantly find myself back to where I started because I'm struggling way more than I did while on medication?

Absolutely, and that f\*\*\*ing sucks.

Not just physically, but mentally and emotionally. It’s the kind of tired that doesn’t go away, no matter how much I sleep. Every day I’m not working or at school, I’m lying in bed, phone in hand, eyes glued to the screen, jumping from one mildly interesting YouTube video to the next. Hours go by before I even realize it. It’s like I’m just stuck in place.

I’m not doing anything anymore. I’m not creating, not enjoying the things I used to love. I’ve tried to break out of it. I really have. I’ve picked up books again, tried to start reading like I used to. But my focus just isn’t there. I’ll finish a page and realize I didn’t absorb a single word. And even if I do manage to get a little momentum going for a few hours, the motivation is gone by the next day. It slips through my fingers before I can do anything with it. My parents refuse to help me get things together again because they don’t take me seriously at all.

I feel ashamed. Like I’ve let myself fall apart and now I’m too far gone to fix it. My confidence is basically gone. I avoid everything I care about because failing at it hurts more than doing nothing. So I keep distracting myself. Anything to keep the thoughts quiet. YouTube, scrolling, noise in the background. It helps just enough to keep me from falling further, but it’s not living. It’s just stalling.

A month ago I was diagnosed with ADHD and level 2 Autism. After years of being told I was just lazy or dramatic, it felt weirdly validating. But when I talk about it, people still act like it’s nothing. Like I’m being ridiculous. I don’t even have any friends to talk to either. It makes me shut down even more.

I’m supposed to start medication soon. That’s the only thing I’m holding on to right now. But until then, I’m stuck here. Lying in bed, letting the hours pass. Not because I want to. Because I don’t know what else to do.

Basically I had been off meds for a couple months and I was starting to break down. I ended up paying waaaay too much for a psych and therapist that first month. 

As soon as I found a free therapist and paych, I canceled the service with BetterHelp in the chat box (since there wasn’t any way to contact them on their website that I could find)

They are not on yelp, all of their reviews are from blog posts on random websites.. I just can not even. 

I finally found a number, and I called them earlier this week. They apologized and said that they’d refund it in 2-3 days. Guess what I’m still waiting on? 

Run, do not walk. I looked in my chat box (with my therapist that I met with once) and every month, the a couple days before I was charged, he messaged, 

“just checking in..”

Sir, if I had known I was paying you $65 dollars a week I would expect more from you. I could find a hooker for cheaper to talk about my feelings.

You think I was donating almost $800 to be “checked in on” via in-app message? I could actually be dead. I’d expect contacting my emergency contact, up to and including a police wellness check, or you FLYING TO MY CITY TO KNOCK ON MY DOOR.

For reference $65 dollars a week is 5 hours at minimum wage after taxes. 

$780 is 60 hours on minimum wage after taxes. 

For $780, you could fly from LA to NYC ROUND TRIP.

ty174m,Today I learned what ADHD medication actually does to the brain and it kind of changed the way i think about my brain.,HEXXIIN,3711,2022-04-06 18:08:06,441,"If you are like me, I have always been told ADHD meds calm the ADHD brain. So I know I took that at face value, I should be more calm right? Less random thoughts, less anxiety, more calm? Well when I was talking to be doctor and explained i dont feel calm or anything, she explained what the meds are actually doing in my brain in a way i have never heard or thought of myself. And this explanation kind of unlocked a lot of understanding of my own brain.

Brains need stimulation to perform executive function. Neurotypical brains need the ""normal"" amount of stimulations that a ""normal"" day will give them. (using the word normal very loosely). ADHD brains need more stimulation to perform and a normal day does not provide the level we need.

So what simulant meds do it provide the missing simulant our brain needs to do those same executive functions. Sounds obvious right? It very much was not for me as I was always told it ""calms the ADHD brain"" and I took that as *I will be more calm*. 

I will always have more racing thoughts, i will always be a bit more hyper or impulsive or whatever. But having meds explained to me in this way kind of helps me accept that. Im not going to be calm, that can't be me, but i am going to have my brains hunger for simulation met. It will bridge that gap so I dont have to try and bridge it myself with things that really wont help long term on in healthy ways. I was so stuck on the work ""calm"" that I started to feel like a failure. I had the stimulation vs. able to perform backwards. Meds don't lower my need to stimulation to perform, it provides it.

Without medication, the ADHD brain does two things to try and fix that gap of stimulation vs. able to perform. It will either look for extra stimulation through fidgeting, over eating, over spending, whatever else. So you will find yourself needing to write an essay but you end up watching youtube, playing video games or whatever else on the computer other than doing the task you need to. Or it will say ""hey this is took hard"" and shut down and you just can't perform anything, often times just mindless on the couch or bed.

This explanation might feels obvious to some, but it wasn't to me. And just hearing this is helping me not only understand my brain, but accept the way it works. I am not trying to fix it, lower my needs, invalidate it, I am giving it what it needs.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/ty174m/today_i_learned_what_adhd_medication_actually/,True,False

I was diagnosed WAY later in life at 33. Typical smart kid, I struggled in high-school and college. I have a professional job life seems great on the outside, and that's why I was missed. 

It feels as if there is a constant parallel between what women have been through in society and what minorities have been through in society.  My fiance is a doctor and she tells me how in medicine women and minorities have symptoms overlooked more often than white men. A black woman might tell her PCP she suspects she has an issue but will be followed up with or checked thoroughly much less than a white man.

kjz76t,"""I like you better when you're off your meds""",None,3685,2020-12-25 05:42:34,237,"My boyfriend, his brothers, his mom, and I were all going to a drive-through light show near my house. His brothers were being very rambunctious, we were packed in a very warm and stuffy car, and needless to say I was feeling very overstimulated. The brothers kept getting out of the car and running around the lights, which made me really nervous. I suppose his mom didn't mind, but my boyfriend and I did. I think she took our discontent with the brothers' antics as being scrooges. I was particularly annoyed because when I'm overstimulated, I get really pissy and that in of itself annoys me so it's a never-ending cycle.

At some point, the mom just turns to me and says, ""you know, I like you better when you're off your meds. You're more fun that way!"" The ironic thing is that my meds had worn off at that point. That WAS me off my meds. If they hadn't worn off, I might've been able to handle everything better. I told her, ""Well, my meds have worn off by now so..."" I don't think she heard me.

My meds make it so I can remember things, I can read better, I can articulate myself better, I'm not so angry all the time, and I'm way more confident in myself because my meds help me do the things that I know I can do despite my ADHD. 

This is not to say that the person I am without my medication is a bad person. They are the same person. My unmedicated self is not unlikeable and broken. I'm not obligated to be unmedicated or medicated to please other people; I'm medicated because it helps me function in this weird world where disabilities and mental illness are seldom taken into consideration or met with empathy.

It can be tough to love ourselves when we are overwhelmed, overstimulated, fighting impulsive or intrusive thoughts, or anything that ADHD makes us believe.

t2ctan,"572 days later, I finished the Duolingo Chinese course!!!!!!!",creatingnewusername,3640,2022-02-26 17:43:33,245,"I FREAKIN DID IT YALL!!!!!!! 572 days ago, I started doing daily Duolingo. I started because I wanted to have one small habit that I did every day to better myself. I was a mess; I had dropped out of college, wasn’t taking my meds, and felt like I was aimlessly drifting through my life. Like many people in this sub, my ADHD makes it stupidly difficult to stick with anything for long periods of time. I get bored, discouraged, then give up and try some other activity instead of finishing what I started. I promised myself this time I would actually stick it out and complete an entire language course. 

Duo’s reward system and reminders were incredible at helping me keep with the program. I hated them at first, but then came to appreciate the way they guilt tripped me into keeping my promise. After seeing how doing one small task everyday over time added up to big results, I began adding more little habits and eventually built a whole self care routine. I’ve never ever done anything like that before. 

Thanks to Duo showing me the power of healthy habits, I reenrolled in classes (and graduated this December!!!), went back to therapy/restarted meds, began writing a daily journal, and overall feel more in charge of the path my life is on. I still can’t believe I stuck with something for 572 days straight. Absolutely blows my mind.

Edit 3: 早安大家人！(Good morning everyone!) 


To answer some of the comments about my Chinese proficiency before/after Duolingo:

-My Chinese proficiency after completing Duolingo is intermediate. I’ve took a free online HSK tests and I’m level HSK4 fluent. 

-Duolingo was great for teaching me to read characters/pinyin. But my speaking/listening comprehension could use improvement. I’m looking to find a speaking partner/tutor to get better at spoken conversations. 

-I did take Chinese lessons in elementary school for a few months. My parents forced me into them, so I never practiced outside of class and therefore retained only the most basic of basics. This helped me with recognizing tones, which is definitely an area Duo needs improvement in. When I started Duo, I tested out of the first 3 lessons (stuff like numbers 1-10, hello/goodbye, my name is ____). The two best things I remember about lessons growing up were making 饺子 (jiao zi, dumplings) and the phrase 马马虎虎(ma ma hu hu). 


Why I chose Chinese/what kept me motivated:

-I wanted to learn Chinese because of China’s growing economic and cultural influence on the world. I didn’t want to reply on google translate to interact with people online and/or read Chinese news sites. I also wanted to break out of my very ‘Merican expectation that everyone knows English lol

-I told myself 5 minutes/1 lesson was better than none whenever I felt tired or lazy. Once I saw my streak get to the triple digits, I was too invested to consider losing it. I let myself get invested in climbing the weekly leagues and completing all the achievements.


EDIT 4: GRAMMAR FACTS

Chinese is an extremely logical language. I love its simple elegance. The sentence structure is almost always SUBJECT VERB OBJECT. To say something like “where are you right now?” is “你现在在哪儿？” which literally translates to “you now location where”. 

Another thing I like about the grammar is the possessive 的。If something is yours, you put 的 in front of it. “This is my cat” is 这是我的猫。我 = me,I 的 = possessive (together, 我的 = my) and 猫 = cat. 

他，她，& 它。All three characters are pronounced the same (ta). But the first one means him, the second is her, and the last is ‘it’ (for referring to animals, “这是我的猫、它是八岁” “this is my cat, it is 8 years old”). So if you’re in a spoken conversation, you need more context to figure out the gender of the person you’re talking about.

tfh4oa,ADHD things I wish people talked about,None,3625,2022-03-16 06:00:31,517,"EDIT: So a lot of you have been saying that you'll be sending this post to your friends and family so I decided to make it more coherent and organized since this originally started out as a rant. I'll also be making it less personal so that your loved ones don't have to read about my embarrassing ADHD stories. 

So basically, ADHD is seen as “quirky ahaha I can’t focus and I fidget a lot and... ooh is that a squirrel!!?” and I hate it. It’s not taken seriously at all and I blame the misinformation online.

So here is a list of ADHD things I wish people talked about: 

- Working Memory Issues: seriously, as soon as a thought comes to my mind, it goes away and I can’t remember what I was about to do or what I was thinking about. I need constant reminders in order to get anything done and important things like names, events, dates, and so much more feel impossible to remember without someone reminding me about them.  

- Time Jumps…Skips: I'm not sure what else to call this and this probably happens due to a combination of working memory issues and zoning out. I'll be so zoned out while doing something and then I'll snap out of it and suddenly minutes or hours have passed by and I can't remember what I was doing or why I was doing it. 

- Time Blindness: I can't differentiate between minutes and hours or months and years. My perception of time is so skewed. I'm always overestimating or underestimating how long something is going to take and this leads to being late to everything including school, family gatherings, outings with friends, and important appointments. 

- Emotional Dysregulation: it feels like I have intensified emotions and inappropriate reactions to everything. Dr. Russel Barkley said that our development is 30% behind our peers. That makes sense because I (F18) feel like I do have the emotions of a 12 year-old girl. I get angry and sad over the most trivial things and when I'm happy, I'm annoyingly happy. My emotions are turned up to 100%. I'm also overly sensitive to rejection. I do not take criticism well. If someone criticises me in anyway, I will lose my shit and have a mental breakdown. I will begin overanalyzing everything about myself and feel intense self-hatred even if the criticism that was given to me was constructive. If I sense the smallest shift in personality from my friends, I will also lose my shit. They could be having a generally bad day but I'll assume that it was somehow my fault and that everyone's mad at me (EDIT: I may also have co-morbid BPD, I’m figuring it out with my psychiatrist) 

- Impatience: I have this need for everything to be done NOW. I’ll have a to-do list of 10+ things and I want them all to be done at the same time. This causes me to get overwhelmed and anxious which leads to doing nothing. I also interrupt people because I want them to TALK FASTER and I'll cry and get angry if something I want doesn’t happen NOW (related to emotional dysregulation). 

- Masking: because I’m hyperactive, some might say my personality is loud/annoying/obnoxious and so on. Of course, this leads to masking and masking caused me to develop social anxiety. My masking also consists of obsessively checking to compensate for my shit memory. It's a waste of time and it's exhausting. I've become a perfectionist in order to cover up my ADHD symptoms and avoid making silly mistakes. 

- Lack of Dopamine: this means I don't have the motivation to do anything that doesn’t give me instant dopamine, which means an inability to start a task, which means procrastination, which means missing deadlines. This also means that I’m chronically bored and constantly looking for a way to stimulate myself. 

- Constantly Drifting Away From My Friends: this is a mix of a ton of the other symptoms but mostly the fact that I'm too disorganised/overwhelmed/bored/forgetful to check up on my friends and I only talk to them when I’m physically with them which leads to drifting. 

- ""Out of Sight, Out of Mind"": if it's not in front of me, I will forget it exists (including my friends, which relates to my last point)

- Hyperfixations: I hate that the internet has changed the meaning of this word to mean anything you like or enjoy. Anyway, when I do have a hyperfixation, it becomes my only source of dopamine, it’s the only thing I can focus on, and the only thing I want to talk about. When I don’t have a hyperfixation, I become extremely understimulated and my symptoms look like depression until I find a new hyperfixation. 

- Inattention: I can’t drive, keep up with conversations, keep up with teachers, movies, books, etc 

- Can’t Take Care of Myself: can’t keep up with hygiene (due to lack of motivation or forgetfulness), I forget to drink water and eat food, I can’t clean my room, and I never remember to do my skin-care routine. 

- Distractibility: every sound and every movement will grab my attention and it makes it so hard to finish anything

- Sensory Issues: I get sensory overloads a lot probably due to the fact that I’m so hyperaware of my surroundings (every sound and movement) but I also have misophonia which worsens my sensory issues. 

- Brain Never Shuts Off: racing thoughts 24/7 and sometimes I just wanna sleep or focus and it feels impossible. Also, my brain works faster than my body, causing me to mess up my speech, writing, etc. 

- Others: issues with self-esteem and binge eating (due to lack of dopamine)

- Impulsiveness: I never think before I do anything. I impulse spend like crazy, I sometimes say insensitive things, and so on. 

I'm so glad this post resonated with so many of you and I'm glad we can have these types of conversations since we all know what it feels like. ADHD is an extremely exhausting and debilitating disorder to live with and not many people understand that.

It makes it even worse if they’re married, older than me, or in a position of power, they become 1000x more attractive to me if I can’t have them. I just think the notion of meeting someone available, getting to know them, and mutually agreeing to be attracted to each other is terrifying. What if they find out about my self-esteem issues? About how hard it is to take care of myself and my life? About how difficult it is to sustain interpersonal relationships?

Edit: wow, I’m amazed at some of these replies and I’m so happy that people relate to this!

Thanks again to everyone who left a comment!!

Edit 2:

This could also very well be a manifestation of bpd and not necessarily something that someone with just adhd might experience. It’s valuable to post to this subreddit because bpd is a common comorbidity of adhd, symptoms frequently overlap, and many people will still relate to this. I might struggle with some symptoms of bpd, but it does not 100% explain the struggles many of us deal with inattention/hyperactivity/impulsivity/executive function issues etc. The two are not mutually exclusive, and it is often not just one or the other. Thanks for invalidating me.

2. They quickly get annoyed and confused with your impulsiveness and lack of conscientiousness. 

3. They (usually) accept your idiosyncrasies and realise you’re actually smart, interesting and refreshing. 

4. Eventually the frustration mounts up and (whilst they may still like you as a person) the relationship slowly but inevitably begins to die. 

Sometimes there’s a happy ending but oftentimes there isn’t.

Sound familiar?

Here’s a case study with my manager; 

During the interview he acted as though I was a breath of fresh air - I like to think I genuinely am sometimes - my random tangential responses made me appear more relaxed and interesting and he hired me on the spot in fact.

Then over the next few weeks the cracks began to emerge and I’d make frustrating mistakes in processes he had already run my through several times, forget crucial details, leave customers on hold for hours, forget things he told me etc and he began to get annoyed and frustrated.

Then over the next few months when we formed a slightly more personal bond I was able to disclose
My ADHD and you know explained the atavistic survival advantages if we were a tribe I would be keeping his ass alive and random other factoids and shit - he became aware that I’m actually the smarter person in the building in a more abstract sense and would run ideas and theories and things past me and even asked me for some personal advice. I excelled at building rapport with people but my lack of attentiveness remained as my crown of thorns. 

... but 6 months or so in the frustrations around my immutable lack of attention to detail and tardiness and the fallout of that has just started becoming intolerable for him, and he basically just told me that he thinks I have lots of positive qualities but the job isn’t really for me ( he’s not wrong) and he doesn’t have time to be mopping up my mess.

So I told him I’m in the process of finding other work (I am and have been for a while) and he expressed that we should still catch up over a drink every now and then. Even though I know part of him means it I know that we never will. 

//

This is actually the usual concatenation of unfortunate events with friendships and even romantic relationships too.
“I like (or maybe even love) you but I’ve got to let you go for the sake of my own psyche” is sort of the vibe I often get.  Or my lack of clear communication is interpreted as lack of effort and the relationship collapses.

I know I possess all the qualities people have pointed out in me, I know my intentions are pure and I’m trying to try but I can’t help but feel like shit knowing that In most cases I’ll end up disappointing people and it’s not a matter of it but when. 

It can make it hard to believe that you’re a truly worthwhile person.

But we must believe it, even if the whole world seems to turn its back on us. 

We must recognise our own intrinsic value. 

We’re trying to succeed in a society that isn’t built for our success.

We’re trying.



———————————————————————-

Edit: 
Also worth noting that my craving for novel stimulation definitely results in a significant drop in attention and investment at work and in personal relationships - so it’s likely that my effort and performance in these areas does decrease and it’s not just a matter of withering peoples patience and tolerance. 
(Losing a job is bad but seeing a personal relationship disintegrate because of this is crushing) 

I’m sure most of us can relate to this as well.

Edit 2: I know this post walks the line between self pity, catharsis and self compassion, but it really wasn’t intended to come out as bleak as it did.

So here’s an addendum:

We must be kind to ourselves, but that doesn’t entail wallowing in despair. We can and should strive to improve our areas of deficiency whether that’s through medication, behavioural therapy and modification, mindset shifts, environmental changes etc.

I always tell myself that even if the chances of reaching my elusive “potential” is 1/10000000000, is that not still worth trying for?

Most of all remember that we aren’t bad people regardless of how our actions might be misinterpreted at times. We have a mental disorder. We aren’t deliberately trying to hurt or disappoint anybody. We aren’t useless or inept or braindead or lazy.

I have ADHD myself and my two oldest kids do as well. The oldest and I are both on Vyvanse, and while the improvements from it have been wonderful and life-changing, the process of getting it every month makes me want to bang my head on the desk until my forehead is Klingon-sized.

* Want to request a refill? Sorry, you can't request that in our pharmacy app because **METH!** so you'll have to call the pharmacist and request it over the phone. Every. Single. Month. Yes, I know the prescription shows up in the app and lets you request a refill, but we'll deny that refill request untill you call us. (By the way, because we don't pay our pharmacists enough, they've all quit, so plan to spend at least an hour waiting on hold.) 
* Your local pharmacy is having trouble staffing up enough to fill your prescription? Sorry, you can't move that prescription to another location because **METH!** so you'll have to call your doctor to have them re-issue the prescription to another location for you. Hope *that* location works!
* Want to reduce the number of times you have to call and request your meds? Oh, sorry, you can't have more than 30 days of medication at a time because—you guessed it!—**METH!** so no 90-day prescriptions for you. Hope you remember to call us before you've run out!
* By the way, hope you don't need your medication in a hurry, because we've decided to limit the amount of any ADHD meds we import this year because—sing it with me now!—**METH!** I'm sure the limits on this will be sufficient to meet the needs of—what? Not enough? Oh well, that's too bad. Best of luck with that!
* Did you finally find a process that works for getting your meds consistently refilled from a pharmacy nearby? Hope nothing at all changes in your appointment schedules, prescription submissions from your physician, pharmacy staffing and supply levels, or the phases of the moon, because all of this will then reset and you'll be back to trying to figure out how to do this again!

The entire process appears to have been designed by a bunch of people who *don't* have ADHD to be as deliberately abusive, obstructive, and difficult *for people with ADHD in particular*. Presumably because **METH!** I'm just So. Freaking. Tired. of the whole dance every month.

**EDIT:** Wow, over 3,000 upvotes in 24 hours—I think I touched a nerve! To address a couple common themes in the comments:

* I actually don’t have much of an issue getting my prescriptions (or my kids’) from the doctor — thankfully, the docs we have are good about issuing them and will re-issue to the pharmacy if required to change locations. (I do have to remember to make the followups sometimes, but that’s another issue.)
* At least around here, none of the doctor’s offices will dispense medication directly: I have to get the scrip from the doctor and then take it to the pharmacy to actually get the medication. That’s where the majority of the problem is for me: the pharmacy is an awful morass due to dispensation controls, supply chain limits, corporate stupidity, additional corporate and personal gatekeeping/judgment, and political maneuvering that it’s a HUGE problem to actually GET the medication that I’ve been prescribed. And reading through the comments, my experience isn’t even the worst of the lot, so I’m feeling grateful for that, at least!
* There is, unquestionably, a problem of abuse with at least some ADHD meds. However, I think a great many like Vyvanse get lumped in with the heavily-abused ones, and there is a great deal of discussion to be had over whether the restrictions we have are actually doing anything useful right now or just making honest people suffer needlessly.

142x1op,Recently diagnosed with ADHD at 29. Started Vyvanse 3 days ago. Where did the anxiety I carried with me all my life go!? It feels like someone took my brain and swapped it for a new one.,Caliburner,3548,2023-06-06 16:36:31,437,"I'll make this post super simple as I understand long posts lose alot of us.

I'm 29/M

I've carried anxiety on my back for as long as I can remember.  Ive been on SSRIS for 10+ years but despite it helping me a bit, my scattered thoughts never calmed down. I always thought ADHD was was a term people use for a hyper child, but subsides as you get older and it stops there. Oh how I was wrong. I always felt I was just an anxious person with many ocd triggering thoughts and always being on the verge of a panic attack. realized my whole life Id shy away from certain projects and learning new things at work because I cannot retain information worth anything. I easily get impulsive on little things.  I never had good productivity at work as I'd get distracted way too easily and put off work until the last 2 hours and get cram a brunch in.  I'll talk to someone and 99% of the time when I look at them while they talk, i cannot bring myself to actually listen.  It's affected my relationship with my 1 year old daughter as I was hoping to be a lot more present with her and my wife, but my brain cannot be in the moment. It saddened me because despite being a very affectionate father, I knowfeel like I'm missing out.

Fast forward to a few days ago. I took the plunge and tried Vyvanse. Immediately. When I say immediately.

My anxiously wired brain with 50 open tabs per minute diminished to FOCUSING ON ONE THING AT A TIME. My tiny brain was unable to understand how that was even possible...  did not think about ANYTHING other then... What I was presently doing. And my brain would not let me get distracted. It was bonkers. I had my first deep conversation with my wife in who knows how long the other morning at breakfast My daughter was sitting in her high chair and I was so interested in her every gesture. I paid more attention to her at breakfast than the 5 months I had on parental leave with her.  It's crazy how ADHD can impact your life in a negative way. Another major improvement was simply my focus and alertness. I sat at work for 8 hours at the office today and was so determined to work. I was actually interested and would never get distracted by coworkers chatting around me.

Most importantly - I actually put off trying Vyvanse for 5 months because I was terrified of taking it and driving me right into a panic attack as I do not like any mind altering substances. Boy was I wrong. For the first time in my life - my extremely anxious brain has become focused, with absolutely zero feeling of anxiety. Why hasn't the SSRIS doctors pushed on me for long had the same effect? Funny how things are.

I did connect the dots. 
I was  the most hyper kid growing up. My siblings laugh about it when they recall some moments. I was the craziest. I'd be bouncing on the couch hours on end. 

So maybe being so hyper as a kid switched as I got older and now that I do not have all that energy to be so hyper, my wired brain stayed the same as when I was a little young.

******FOLLOW UP AFTER WRITING MY POST*********

I am FLOORED. I thought I'd maybe have about 5 people have the same vibe from their anxiety being diminished greatly when starting Vyvanse. Thanks everyone for such the kind words. It really makes me smile to see so many people feeling the way I do and enjoying being clearminded. I must add a few other points I've noticed improvement on :

-Less impulsive. I used to get ticked off at the smallest things.

-More self confidence. I no longer feel jealous of people who walk by me and have their head up real high as ive always felt like I lacked confidence.

-No more social anxiety. I used to be so nervous having to go into certain public places, gatherings. This is greatly subsided.

-I am GENUINELY interested in people. As in, I used to never pay much attention to what people had to say due to my ADHD and now I am so involved in 1 on 1 conversations. 

- Not sure if it's dopamine boosting, but I feel a little head rush of happiness much more than I ever had. I'm guinenly happier.

-I no longer get distracted at my desk job.

-I show more affection to my wife and daughter.

- I used to worry about the stresses of future bills and overthinking... Now, I don't even give a shit. When the bill is due, I will have already set it in my calendar to pay it on time.

-My brain no longer gets anxiety. As in, I used to work myself up with some health anxiety... ""Is the food I just ate gone bad?"" ""Will I be I'll?"" ""My chest hurts. I hope my oxygen is okay""... ""Is my wife gonna make it home safe or will there be a car accident""? ""I'm terrified of the day my parents pass away"". ""I'm worried of having a stroke"". ""Do I have fatty liver""? ""I'm out of breath so easily"".... 

When I say shit like that LIVED in my brain all day, plus not being in the moment and focusing on life, I truly mean it.

It makes a week and I have absolutely not given a F**k about any of those things. Because I'm rationalising now. My anxiety is 0.

After all the times I've been helped by this community, this finally feels like my opportunity to give back. Here goes! \*cracks knuckles\*

&#x200B;

So I've been struggling with this lately myself. I've been wanting to learn the guitar for literally years but never had the money to buy one. Now that I have the money to do it I keep getting cold feet and thinking, ""Oh man, I know I'm not gonna be able to stick with it so it's not even worth buying."" But f\*ck it. I'm gonna buy it! Here's how I came to that decision.

&#x200B;

**\*\*1. Be kind to yourself!\*\***

Obviously, #1 universal rule of ADHD, applicable to all scenarios. Self-loathing sucks. Do your best to be kind to yourself. I recently came across the term ""self-compassion"", which I really like. Be at least as nice to yourself as you'd be to other people. You wouldn't make fun of/beat up a loved one who switches hobbies often, so don't do it to yourself!

&#x200B;

**\*\*2. Emphasize dynamic hobbies.\*\***

Someone in yesterday's thread used the phrase ""dynamic hobbies"" and I think that's a god damn genius phrase. We need hobbies that we can pick up for a month or two at a time and completely forget for another few months. That's just how my/our hobbies work! We just need to accept that and choose compatible hobbies. Last month I got *obsessed* with freshwater aquariums. Watched a ton of YouTube videos, went to Petco to scout potential fish, etc. Even bought a fancy ass $100+ fish tank from Amazon! Then I realized that this is \*not\* a dynamic hobby. Forgetting/not caring about my aquarium for months will result in dead fish. **\*ERROR 404: INCOMPATIBLE HOBBY!\*** Fish tank was subsequently returned.

Relatedly, I had a plant in my bedroom that I needed to water every day or few days. That plant is dead as hell. I now have one of those plants that you only need to remember to water once a month (snake plant, if you're wondering!). Plant is thriving! Lol

As far as hobbies go, guitar is super dynamic! If I learn 3 songs this month and no songs for the next two months, no one dies!

&#x200B;

**\*\*3. Reset your expectations.\*\***

Listen, I know myself. I am not about to practice diligently every day for the next year and be performing at local bars in 2 years. That'd be great, but it's a pipe dream. If I define that as the goal, I'm going to fall short and feel shitty. Instead, I'm going to focus on being able to strum a couple songs here and there when I'm bored and maybe learn one song for my girlfriend that I can use to score some romantic brownie points on a birthday/anniversary. That's it. Anything else is icing on the cake. If I do actually end up learning guitar for real, awesome! If I don't, awesome! The point here is to add something to my life that brings me joy, and dammit, strumming along to a song with 4 basic chords from time to time gives me joy! Don't squeeze all the joy out of it by putting too many expectations on it or on yourself.

&#x200B;

**\*\* 4. Reduce the barriers to exit (specifically financially).\*\***

You've heard of ""barriers to entry""? Well, allow me to introduce you to a new concept: barriers to exit. Super important. Recognize and accept that your new ""hobby crush"" may fade with time. When I get excited about a new hobby I am super tempted to buy professional-grade stuff. MISTAKE! When entering a new hobby, recognize that it may not last and make it as easy as possible to get out of financially -- meaning it won't be too much of a loss if (when) you give it up. When starting a new hobby that requires purchasing things, try to force yourself to only purchase entry level stuff until the hobby has stuck around for long enough to justify investing in. Or buy things that can easily be resold on the internet. Entry level DSLR camera that can be resold if you decide you hate photography? Fine. Professional grade DLSR camera engraved with your first and last name and therefore with limited resale value? Not fine. Not fine at all.

This month I started a new workout class. Went to the first class and loved it! Was ready to purchase the $200 month unlimited monthly membership for 12 months! Yay! Then a little voice said, ""Hey man, remember to reduce the barriers to exit. You might not like this next month."" So instead I bought the $50 entry-level package and will re-evaluate my commitment as I go. If it doesn't stick, it won't nearly be as much of a loss!

&#x200B;

**\*\* 5. Don't try harder, try differently!\*\***

Also a foundational ADHD rule. But relevant in literally every scenario...including this one! When it comes to a new hobby, you may need to outsource your executive function to a teacher or class (if you can afford it!). Example: I've had a regular gym membership for 6 months and literally only gone 1 single time. It's just too much to actually figure out what workouts I am supposed to be doing, keep myself accountable to the time set for each exercise, etc. Also tbh it's honestly kind of boring. I signed up for a workout class last week. The only thing I need to do is show up. They already have the exercises planned so I don't need to think about it. And it's a group class so there's constant motivation to push myself from peers. I have exercised 5 times in the last 7 days! That's like an infinity percent improvement from my previous strategy. I would never have gotten there if I was just trying ""harder"" at a strategy that didn't work for me.

&#x200B;

**\*\* 6. Trying new hobbies is a hobby unto itself!\*\***

What is the definition of a hobby? Something you do for fun. Some people collect stamps for fun. Other people watch birds for fun. Others make scrapbooks. You know what I do? TRY NEW HOBBIES! I get pleasure from getting excited about a random thing and diving into it a month at a time. Trying new hobbies is my hobby! No sense in feeling guilt or shame about it when it makes me so god damn happy!

This is a subtle but ***really important*** reframing. Person X would say, ""I collect stamps for fun. Last year I found a rare limited edition 1956 stamp from Montana and a couple from California in the 1760s! I loved it!"" I would say, ""I try new hobbies for fun. Last year I dabbled in photography, guitar, and dog sitting! I loved it!"" Both of us would be having fun doing what we do. Person X would never feel bad about him or herself for not trying ""enough"" new things, so why would I ever feel bad about trying ""too many"" new things?!

&#x200B;

**\*\*TL;DR:\*\*** Be kind to yourself. Accept that your hobbies will have to be dynamic. Instead of trying harder, consider trying differently. Reduce the (financial) barriers to exit. And, most importantly, recognize that trying new hobbies \*is\* a hobby! Godspeed, mateys. Happy hobbying!

Today, my university experienced a shooting. Unfortunately, we experienced casualties and several were injured. I was out in the open heading to the student union to have lunch when I realized I had left my wallet in my classroom. When I got back to my classroom to retrieve my wallet, classmates were receiving news that someone had started opening fire at the building that was a 5 minute walk away from me. 

The place where I was heading was the last place to be at the time and because of me needing to tread back for forgetting my wallet, I incidentally avoided placing myself in another more dangerous situation. 

Still shaken up by what happened, but grateful for my circumstances in terms of being safe. For the victims and families affected by the FSU shooting, I hope we can all keep them in our hearts.

It was a combination of focus issues at school, at work, and at home. I’m very inattentive, forgetful, and disorganized. I find it very hard to maintain relationships. I have struggled a lot with motivation and initiative. I look back at my life and categorize periods of time by my intense hyper-fixation at that time. All of that was a lot to deal with, but I handled it all the same. 

More recently, those things I was dealing with were having a much more significant impact on my work performance and my relationships with friends, family, and my partner. I finally thought it was time to pursue a diagnosis and treatment, so I didn’t lose my job or my partner. And this community gave me the confidence to actually call my doctor and ask for help instead of putting it off even more.

After a month of meeting with a psychiatrist, a therapist, and a very nice clinical psychologist for probably 15 hours total now – I was diagnosed with severe Generalized Anxiety and Autism – but definitely not ADHD based on some of the test results.

I understand my diagnosis, I know its probably right, a lot of what I am experiencing makes sense at the cross section of anxiety and autism – I checked all the boxes. But I still feel a part of this community. I’m still going to struggle with attention, motivation, and initiation. I can still empathize with the struggle of others here. I can still celebrate the victories too. It’s just that my head is a little different than most other people here.

osqt2m,When people think you're slow because you're seeing the puzzle of a situation come together in your head yet have the audacity to lecture you when they finally see the picture you pieced together an entire hour earlier.,Common_Teaching2554,3525,2021-07-27 10:02:35,276,"A couple officemates were trying to sort through a problem at work earlier. I was watching their process and realized that they were going about it all wrong. I noticed that materials that would be relevant towards the end of the process referenced materials that were relevant only at the very beginning. Worse, the materials at the end wouldn't make sense unless they were read in connection with the earlier materials because they involved a series of piece meal amendments.

I suggested an alternative course of action and proposed that we organize by concept first and group co-dependent materials before arranging the concepts in the appropriate flow. They brushed the idea off because they thought my way would just complicate things since all we had to do was arrange chronologically.

Granted, I am not an organized person nor am I responsible or conscientious. There are a lot of things I wouldn't trust myself with.

What I am though is perceptive, perhaps to a fault. Maybe from a lifetime of having every little thing catch my attention, I've somehow developed an innate feel for seeing what pieces stick out or fit together. 

But holy fuck. I absolutely hate it when people assume that because I don't approach things in an ""organized"" manner, there's no way I could know what I'm talking about. 

In the end, the dumb fucks realized that their entire process was redundant. And because they insisted on ""simplifying"" their approach, they ended up having to backtrack and undo their work to make sense of what came later down the line, which could've been avoided if they followed my suggestion. 

But the dumb fucks don't even know that they're dumb. They actually thought that they came up with my idea on their own. And they had the audacity to lecture me to say, ""see if you didn't go through the process, you wouldn't have seen the problem. You can't take shortcuts.""

Except I literally did exactly that. I fucking did 'see the problem' you fucks and I got it from every ounce of my instinct screaming that something was about to go wrong because I've fucked up so much in my life that I can see it coming from a mile away. 

My apologies for the rant. It's been a rough week.

-----

EDIT: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who's shared their experiences in the comments. Posted this after a rough day just wanting to let some steam out and woke up feeling a little less alone in the world thanks to you all. 

Just want to say though, I regret calling my officemates  ""dumb fucks."" They aren't lol. And they have been cool and helpful in the past. It was a snap reaction that I feel came from a mixed bag of feelings. But I do regret the toxicity. 

Last thing I want to say, I noticed some comments that bordered on hating on NTs or linear thinkers and I worry about maybe sparking something negative. 

I get it though. It sucks living in a world that can often feel like it was designed to work against us (and in many ways actually has been). It sucks that we always seem to be the ones forced to adjust to the ""norm"" that's been set by people who just function differently. But I do still think we can afford to hold ourselves to a kinder standard. 

Fuck the system. Be kind to the people trapped in it. And hopefully enough people respond with kindness in turn that the system can go fuck itself maybe.

I’ve fought tool & nail to get ADA accommodations recently at work, fought so hard to get testing accommodations reported and actually put together for my ADHD students at this university, guided others on how to get tested as an adult, had to help a distressed student when they couldn’t get their meds because without them they were struggling but couldn’t afford them….and the university does this. 

I have no idea of how to advocate against this or combat it, but I’m so upset as I know how this will impact so many students especially low-income students and further stigmatize ADHD. 

I want to spread awareness and get takes on how you would approach this? 


Update: apparently they can make this a true decision even with “evidence” according to r/legal. Which is confusing and doesn’t feel right. I’m waiting on more opinions & will be contact other legal avenues to see if there can be a way to change their reason from “doesn’t work” to substance abuse control to help mitigate stigma.

2. Guaranteed way to remember that you did something; do a little dance after you do it.

I’m never 100% sure if I locked my door leaving the house or if I locked my car doors, but whenever I lock the door I do a quick little dance and I always remember doing a stupid dance after I locked my door or turned off the lights.

The more my subconscious believes this the less I fear work and the less it feels overwhelming to start tasks.

mb62yi,Helpful and specific ADHD college tips that have NOTHING to do with studying:,None,3490,2021-03-22 21:01:15,388,"As college students with ADHD, **we hear the same things over and over again:** *""get a planner"", ""set multiple timers"", ""study in the library"", ""Put your phone away"", blah blah blah.""* But how many of them do our brains hear and go ""yooo that's pretty good, Imma do that""? That's right: close to none.

But it's not hopeless for us. One thing I know about us college students with ADHD is that we already know what we should do. However, **the more specific and obscure a tip is displayed, the more our brains will be enticed by it.** And ADHDers require catalyst actions (small actions that eventually snowball) so that we can refrain from having to use our willpower or rely on motivation. Using cues is less likely to drive us into existential despair.

So please grab some water, play a chill song (or repeatedly tap your feet; or both), and enjoy. **These tips will NOT mention how to do your homework or study. I don't want to give you something that might stress you out.** SO instead, I am coming at you with tips that will positively impact other areas, which will hopefully then make it a whole lot easier for your brain to do however much you're able to accomplish in a day with less fuss.

This list is categorized into 6 groups: **waking up on time, getting to places on time, getting stuff done, alleviating stress, getting to bed on time, and the basics.**

# Waking up on time:

**Jar of gummy bears with obscure meme references on the labels:** I keep clear jars of gummy bears (I love them because they are sweet but not too sweet for me) and Crunch bars with labels that reference my favorite memes (the gummy bear one says ""Dumb Bitch Fuel"" and the Crunch one says ""Doge""). They make me sort of laugh when I see them and I tell myself I get to take one of each as soon as I wake up for my short 15-second walk to the bathroom to wash my face and brush my teeth. Having rewards just for waking up sets me up for a good day.

**Invest in a Google Home (and a travel router, dimmable lightbulb, and smart plug):** See, y'all will never convince me that technology has ruined productivity because I truly believe that anything can be useful if you wield it correctly. Our brains don't like doing things that require effort. So why not just cut out the middle man and have an AI do it for us? I use my Google Home Mini (only $49 at Walmart) to set my morning alarm, set reminders, turn on my lights, put on music, send texts, make calls, and help me fall asleep faster by playing rain sounds. For the morning, using the ""Good Morning"" routine (that is customizable), I can know what the weather is like so I can prepare my outfit, get reminders for the day so I don't have to struggle to know what I should do, turn on my dimmable soft white lamp (only $5 at Walmart), turn on my kettle for tea (connected through a smart plug that was $8 at Walmart), and play feel-good music without even lifting a finger! So much energy saved and instead used to get myself to the bathroom and wash my face. 

*(The travel router is for college students with Wi-Fi that requires a Portal Login. Google Home and Smart Appliances do not support Portal Logins and having a travel router helps you create a safer bridge between your devices and your school internet.)*

# Getting to places on time

**Pick a hype and fast-paced songs to walk to your classes with:** I play either Poker Face by Lady Gaga or Boss Bitch by Doja Cat because a) I'm a proud bisexual that had a lesbian phase in elementary school, and b) I know every lyric and beat of those songs and they get me to walk fast with simple quadruple meter beats. Not only do I get to class fast, but I strut. And getting to listen to the music is an incentive to walk out the door.

**Fun sunglasses:** I have essentially no shame and love to display my... eccentricity and authenticity. When I feel like it, I wear fun glasses outside and pretend to be Lady Gaga while I strut to my 8am Spanish class.

**Once you're out, there is no turning back:** we tend to get so bogged down and stressed with how long it's gonna take us to walk to class and waste energy. But you need to look at things much closer. Once you're dressed, you won't be tempted to crawl back to bed. Once you're out your door, you won't be tempted to go back in. Once you start walking, your brain will just keep going because it'll be too tired to make any other decisions. Make it easier on your brain.

# Getting stuff done

**Desk analog clock:** literally just for the aesthetic. It makes my desk look so much more professional and it also has a purpose. I am just more likely gonna be drawn to my desk if it has stuff there that makes sense but also doesn't.

**Forest:** This app was brought to us by the ADHD Gods. For $2.99, you can download Forest and place money bets. Set a timer to get your work done then place a bet in monetary value (I place $5 for easy tasks, $20 for medium tasks, and $100 for hard tasks) and the app basically tracks if you pick up and open your phone before the allotted time for your task has run out. And if you do open your phone to check, it sends you a notification to put it away. If you don't do it on time, you lose your bet and your money. I use this even for stuff like picking up stuff on my floor. This way, even if I don't do shit, at least I take a break from using my phone.

**Statue Head pencil holder:** again, the aesthetic. I love museums and I bought a Statue of David planter that I use as a pencil holder and it just makes my desk so much more inviting. I'm more likely to sit down and do something.

**Laptop riser, mechanical keyboard, and mouse or external trackpad:** BAD POSTURE HURTS. I spent so much of high school crouched over my laptop and not only would that cause me pain and strain, but it would also tire me out and irritate me. I bought a high laptop riser that places my screen up at eye level so that I can sit straight. Buying a mechanical keyboard to hook it up to the laptop eliminates the need to reach across and use my regular keyboard and helps place my hands at a more relaxed level (plus I love the Brown and Blue switch sounds and the RGB settings). I'm a mouse girl, but if you prefer, you can buy an external trackpad as well. The investment is SO WORTH IT!!

**Fountain pens in different colors:** I don't know what it is about fountain pens, but they motivate me to write pretty notes, even if it's just a reminder to take out the trash. They are so satisfying to write with.

# Help out with stress

**Buy a hot water bottle:** having something warm and inviting against your body helps calm down your breathing, slow your heart rate, and clear your mind, which lowers the production of cortisol (our stress hormones). It's a cheap and better option than a teddy bear.

**Buy with Cash when purchasing in person:** Do you ever have that moment of ""oh shit, how much money did I spend this month?""? Use cash for in-person purchases and for online purchases, use your banking app to set a limit. Being aware of your finances in the simplest and least stressful way possible lets your mind have more space to think about other things.

**Follow the random urges:** most of our urges don't harm anyone or anything. Do you want to skip and hop on your morning walk? Do it. Do you want to dance while brushing your teeth? Do it. When appropriate, remind yourself to stop masking. It alleviates the stress you place on your mind to retain self-control.

**Pastel sticky notes:** Brightly colored sticky notes make me not want to read them. Buying softer colored sticky notes and instead of using a bold black marker to write my reminders down will make it more likely that I'll look at it. Backgrounds need to be softer if we want our brains to not get too visually stimulated before we get the chance to read what is on the paper.

**Buy a desk lamp with outlets and pencil holders:** If you're the type of person where when you're scrolling on Reddit at your desk and you use your phone wanting to charge as a catalyst to get in bed and hibernate there, then this tip is for You! Use a desk lamp with outlets so that you can easily charge your phone there and use Reddit while sitting down. That way you're more likely to get tired of it when you get uncomfortable.

**Paint your water bottle in a stark but inviting aesthetic:** I painted mine in the Kawaii fashion, with my favorite pink-haired anime characters in chibi style, along with sakura flowers. My life aesthetic is dark academia. But Kawaii is so soft and stands out amongst my old books and vintage decor. It makes me want to pick it up and drink. Oh, and bonus: my bottle has a straw.

# Getting to bed on time

**Lavender pillow spray:** Lavender scents help most people fall asleep and there are actually sprays that you can spray on your pillow that are safe to sleep against and inhale so closely. It makes falling asleep so much easier for me. (Along with rain or fan sounds).

# The basics

**Dental care cup:** Do you find it hard to brush your teeth in the morning? If you do not already have your dental stuff in the bathroom, this one is for you: buy a pretty cup from the dollar store and put your toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss in there, and put it on your nightstand or desk. That way on your way to pee, it's right there for you to pick up and bring with you.

**Meme shower reward:** I love uploading memes to r/adhdmeme so I use showering as a thinking space for what I upload. I tell myself I can upload a meme there if and only if I shower. It definitely does the job!

**Frequent your local Dollar Store:** Buying snacks and making useless impulse purchases is hard when shit is so expensive. The solution? Thrift shops and the Dollar Store. I buy my chips, nuts, frozen fruits, brownie mixes, and other small snacky foods there, so I can buy a bunch of them without spending too much money. 

**Star-shaped stickers to congratulate yourself for doing the basics... and reward yourself:** Yes, I use the star sticker reward system for ""stuff that I should already be doing because they're important."" Who gives a shit? Surviving is HARD and getting out of bed and brushing my teeth and eating and showering are TOUGH. So yeah, I give myself sparkly stickers on a colorful board for how many times I brushed my teeth and then I give myself a reward. 

Please keep in mind that I use these tips in conjunction with therapy and medication and CBT. If I want these tips to be effective, I also need to work on my baseline mood and mindset. Take care of yourself internally. And remember: there is nothing wrong with you and you're doing the absolute best that you can. And I'm so so SO damn proud of you <3",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/mb62yi/helpful_and_specific_adhd_college_tips_that_have/,True,False
1eu7kfx,Being Japanese with ADHD is a nightmare,Ok_Medium1628,3495,2024-08-16 19:56:57,255,"The Japanese culture and ADHD are a terrible match. I'm Japanese and live in the UK now, but in Japan, there's this strong emphasis on mannerisms—putting others before yourself and avoiding being a bother. There’s also a lot of pressure to conform and perfectionism. Unlike the UK’s pioneering spirit, Japan values following precedent over taking risks. Failure is harshly judged, and there’s a collective mindset where mistakes are seen as personal responsibility whatever takes. This makes for a strict rule environment. For someone with ADHD, it’s a nightmare. Constantly being criticized for careless mistakes adds immense stress. I room shared with one Japanese woman now and she's this type. A NIGHTMARE. It’s incredibly difficult to navigate, and I struggle a lot due to my internalized Japanese traits.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1eu7kfx/being_japanese_with_adhd_is_a_nightmare/,True,False
ezu2nx,"I have showered, eaten, cleaned, and followed a bedtime routine for 4 days this week!!!",Captain_Bojanggles,3493,2020-02-06 07:40:44,133,"This week I have showered 4 days in a row. Including a full routine of getting ready. Hair, face and beard washed, moisturized, put on deodorant, done my hair, put on clean clothes, and cleaning up my mess! I also ate the same regime of food in the morning for 4 days before my adderal kicks in and I lose my appetite. I've come home and stayed active doing chores, getting dinner ready, cleaning as I go, and cleaning up the house entirely when the children are in bed. I EVEN DID FULL LOADS OF MY LAUNDRY!!!!! Washed, dried, folded, and put away. I even avoided my usual distractions. Kept video games to a limited time, turned the tv off when it was time for bed and was head down, eyes closed before 1130 every night. 

Wildly successful week on that end!!!!!!!!

Edit: Only on this thread do I appreciate, and count my self lucky to be among, a bunch of disorganized freaks. We are what anyone may consider to be freaks. After all, we are actually different in many ways. It's not just a chemical imbalance for us... We have different brains. We literally have to try and take our brains, and incorporate the functions of NT's to function properly. 

I read a book recently that called the ADHD mind a hunters mind. And the mind of NT's a Farmer's mind. We have a brain that was suitable to be a hunter gatherer millenia ago, but not for the farmers world of today full of distraction and menial, down right boring, tasks that make loves function. 

I'm just so glad that I have this place to share my success and get such a fantastic response! My friends, peers, and family literally cannot truly appreciate this success as anything significant, because they can't even fathom the effort it takes to work against your own biology. You guys are all fantastic! Thank you!

This is a comment I made down below. It dawned on me that it may be a good edit to show my appreciation for all of the support and praise I have recieved. You have truly bolstered me to keep on going.... Only I've now spent a large majority of my night reading and responding to all you lovely people, and not enough time doing human things!

j99a2z,The way ADHD meds work is super interesting to me. Here's something really cool I've noticed.,None,3485,2020-10-11 10:14:47,407,"Maybe this is something super obvious but I'm new to ADHD and the meds so I was really fascinated by this!

I am 26F and my grandma has been teaching me how to knit. Knitting is actually pretty cool, but it's moreso an excuse to hang out with my grandma. At the end of each row she'd have me count my stitches to make sure I didn't accidentally add one or lose one. 

Before meds I'd count the stitches and if there was any kind of background noise I had to restart midway. I'd always recount them too because I usually made mistakes. I would really have to put energy into focusing on it, and I had to touch every stitch with my finger to be sure I counted it.

On meds, and I don't know how to describe it, but I can count stitches accurately and really quickly. I don't have to even touch the fabric. My eyes just count the stitches and there isn't any mistakes. It's easy.

It's almost like having ADHD is like having someone in your brain shout other numbers when you're trying to count, and on meds, that person shuts up.

What interesting things have you noticed?
😊

Edit: I've also noted that on meds my handwriting is insanely better! It's like night and day.

pkzljq,"End of ADHD psychiatry session: ""Call my office to have them set up your next appointment."" You know I have ADHD, right? I will make that call in about 6 months.",dralth,3490,2021-09-09 08:06:06,294,"This is partly a rant but also a success story that I hope will help others. Pre-diagnosis, found a psychiatrist because I suspected I have ADHD (mostly thanks to you fine people and your stories and support, thank you!).

I’d never worked with a psychiatrist before, but there were a few red flags:

- after asking questions about my past to diagnose me, he prescribed Ritalin because, “if it helps, then you probably have ADHD”

- after it helped, I asked if he is diagnosing me with ADHD, and he replies, “the goal isn’t a diagnosis, it’s symptom management”. My insurance disagrees.

- 1 hr sessions ended in 15 minutes when he seemed to get board and abruptly ended the session saying, “I’ll renew your prescription and you keep at it.”

- he ended the sessions with the quote from the title. He got upset when it took me 8 weeks to call and set up my 6 week follow up. I asked if I could just set up the next session now on the phone and he got annoyed and said, “just call my office, please. And don’t wait this time.”

After two sessions I was done with him and found another psychiatrist. The new guy re-diagnosed me, gave a prescription with more informed starting dosage, and before my first session his assistant set up two sessions in advance so I wouldn’t have to schedule the follow up myself.

I know we don’t always have choice with healthcare, as we go where our referrals, insurance in-networks, and bank accounts allow us to go. But as far as possible, my advice is not to settle for a bad psychiatrist. If it doesn’t feel right, it isn’t right. There’s a good fit for you out there somewhere. Keep trying to find it.

This community gave me the tools and expectations to recognize a bad fit, and I’m grateful. I hope my story contributes back in some small way.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/pkzljq/end_of_adhd_psychiatry_session_call_my_office_to/,True,False

Of course the comments are filled with agreement and about how more kids just need spankings. Yes, because abuse will fix how my brain was wired, *sigh* that worked well. I got a lot of spankings. Grew up in an abusive home. Didn’t cure me, in fact, now I just have trauma AND ADHD. Makes me really sad that so many people don’t understand mental health, but I know this is newer information that a lot of people from older generations just don’t ‘get.’ 

Still.... I’m absolutely sick and tired of adhd being seen as bratty kids that need more discipline. There are REAL things happening in our brains. Our struggles are REAL. We are not just lazy or defiant. And we are more than just kids. It doesn’t go away just because you grow up. I like this family member, but anyone preaching this kind of thing makes me really want to tell them to shut the fuck up because they don’t know what they’re talking about. It really pisses me off. I don’t share having ADHD with any of my family because they’d either think it’s just an excuse to be lazy or I’d get ‘advice’ consisting of “have you tried getting more exercise and consuming more omega 3/cutting out gluten etc...”

11h4shs,40 days brushing teeth in a row. My tip for regularly brushing my teeth.,None,3457,2023-03-03 08:21:32,380,"Maybe some of you are in similar situations where you constantly forget to brush your teeth. I have been like this for years, going days to weeks forgetting to brush.

This may be weird or obvious to some but, one day I had this odd idea to use a dry erase marker and write the number of days brushed in a row on my bathroom mirror. This made me see it often which reminded me. When the number starts getting large like 20+ I started getting hyper vigilant because I didn't want to lose that number.

So far this has been the most successful tool for me. Does anyone else have odd things that surprisingly work for reminders?

Edit: If you don't have a dry erase marker realistically a sharpie would probably work as long as you used alcohol to remove it. I have not tested this though so do not take my word as gospel

I’m tired of them saying shit like “I’m so ADHD because I occasionally space out” or “I have ADHD because I could relate to this one TikTok audio vaguely describing a symptom of ADHD” (slight exaggeration, but my point is the same)

That’s not to say everyone who is open about their ADHD or makes jokes about it is immediately faking, in fact that’s the last thing I want to assume about someone who says they have ADHD. However, every single person who is most likely faking romanticizes it so much that most of their “symptoms” are either symptoms that most non-ADHD people experience to some extent or literal misinformation

ADHD is not occasionally zoning out, being hyper, or liking to play with fidget toys, and it especially isn’t blinking to the beat of TikTok audios (I can’t believe I had to add that either, but apparently it’s a thing)

ADHD is not being able to do basic tasks efficiently most of the time because you’re not able to focus on them

ADHD is forgetting things often

ADHD is having to stim or not being able to sit still to where it’s annoying for you and/or others around you

ADHD is having sensory issues

ADHD is having trouble sleeping

ADHD is having poor organization skills

I did not get labeled as lazy, annoying, weird, messy, etc. and have things be 10 times harder for me my whole life, and on top of that have my struggles be blown off because I “didn’t seem like I had ADHD” and I would “grow out of it” (likely because I’m afab), just for people to romanticize and spread misinformation about ADHD for attention.

I KNOW THIS. However, who do you think regularly tells themselves ""it will be different this time""? This guy! I could literally have spent 2 hours on the phone that morning, learn the lesson, and got to bed later that night.... Phone in hand.

I once saw a Twitter post that cracked me up that said:

""I finally got around to doing something I've been putting off for 3 months. It took 20 minutes. I will learn absolutely nothing from this.""

I'm sure many ADHD'ers saw that and related! I think the statement, though really funny and true, is technically not the whole truth. I DID learn the lesson, I just forgot it a bit too quickly! But here is the thing, I WILL learn that lesson again!

But like many other ADHD folks, I rarely miss people when they're not around, and therefore rarely get the urge to make plans with them or even randomly write to them to ask how they've been. 

I like hanging out with them, I just don't need a lot of social contact to be happy - a hang out session will usually ""last"" me a long time. Kinda like how a good meal means you don't feel hungry for the next few hours. Therefore they're usually the ones who take the initiative to ask me to hang out. I make it a point to accept unless I really can't, because I know most people feel upset/neglected if you don't see them a lot and they mean a lot to me so I don't want that. Plus, I know I'll have fun once I'm there. To continue with the meal analogy, it's kinda like when you're not hungry but still wouldn't turn down a tasty snack like popcorn/candy. 

The thing is, I tend to always feel like I'm very busy because every task I can envision feels like an emergency. 90% of the time my mind is just a mess of all the things I have to do and it feels like a lot even if to a regular person it wouldn't be that bad. As a result, making/accepting plans with friends sometimes feels like just another thing on my already full & stressful to-do list. I feel kinda guilty for rarely initiating things, and often accept plans out of a feeling of obligation to maintain the friendship. Once I'm there I pretty much always end up enjoying myself and being glad I went but sometimes I still feel the stress of every other thing I should be doing in the back of my mind.

“You might have ADHD if you leave your house and forget to lock the door behind you 🤪”

“If you’re super organized you probably have ADHD 😝”

Bro I can’t even make it an hour some days without forgetting a task I had to take care of. I’ve straight up missed school assignments that were right in front of me and I have no way to explain it to my professors without sounding like I’m complaining and they don’t take me seriously. 

I’ve tried Guanfacine, nothing. Switched to Ritalin, nothing. My psychiatrist told me the Ritalin should have worked, I had to explain it wasn’t working for me. I’m on 20mg of Adderall now and I still don’t feel like it’s helping. I’m constantly moving around, I can’t sit still, my wife hates me for it, my coworkers tell me I’m autistic because of how I act and laugh about it, and I’m straight up doing my best to hold it together on a daily basis.

Oh well, I chat with my friend for a couple of minutes and then head back to pick up her lunchbox and...the phone rings. It's the school wondering where I am. IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME!

Excerpt:

>FDA has approved several first generics of Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine dimesylate) capsules and chewable tablets for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in patients six years and older and moderate to severe binge-eating disorder (BED) in adults. See Vyvanse’s prescribing information for details on dosing.

Looks like pharmacies are able to order the generic version now (according to an independent pharmacy near me)

Let's hope they're as good as the original...! And that the price comes down

EDIT/UPDATE: I received my first fill of generic Vyvanse today! Colors are the same as the brand-name. The manufacturer for mine is Mallinckrodt.

rvlval,"How do you escape the ""Content Trap""?",CaptainJackWagons,3389,2022-01-03 20:44:57,401,"The content trap is my term for describing when your brain lacks stimulation and it almost feels like there's a hole where something should be. So you keep looking at content on your phone that you think might fill the hole, but nothing quite scratches that itch and every time you close your phone to get up, you feel the loss of what little stimulation you did find on youtube or twitter, and immediately open the app back up without even realizing it. You end up glued to the coutch trying to scratch that itch so you can get on with your day.


Some days I can't even leave my house without the right podcast episode or audio-book in my ears, so when I can't scratch the itch, I'm just stuck.

EDIT: to clarify, I specifically mean when you feel like you need to find the *right* piece of content before you can feel fulfilled and move on with your day. I don't mean scrolling just because you're bored. Sometimes I do actually find it and am able to move on. but most times I'm stun locked and glued to my seat until I can satisfy the urge.

EDIT2: Since this is getting a lot of traction and I want to elevate the response I found the most helpful so far, which says to put down the phone and then literally do nothing. That is to say, sit in silence and do either controlled breathing and/or close your eyes. essentially, meditate, even if it isn't mediation, for at least a few seconds to sort of soft reset your brain. thank you to u/happygocrazee


EDIT3: Had my session with my adhd specialist/life coach today. She went into all the chemistry of it, but the conclusion was that the only two things that *reset* your brain are exercise and music, so music it is then when I get stuck on the couch, lol! I think the sitting and doing nothing still helps for a short time, but if you want to be good for a while, play some music to shift your mood and go out for a walk. For those of you who keep switching songs, she said you need to give the music time to do it's work.

She asked what my GPA was. I told her. I mentioned I used to be called ""gifted"". I told her about all my symptoms and difficulties since I was a child.

She said gifted children don't have ADHD. She said no ADHD person can be an engineering student. She said that ""now people hear those things from the USA and they think they know what they're talking about"". She said she wouldn't change her mind. She asked who was the first person to consider the possibility. I answered ""myself"". She replied ""yeah, I figured"", to which I said ""but three psychiatrists have confirmed it"". She said they must have no idea what they're talking about. I left.

I am devastated. The reason I wasn't diagnosed sooner is because my grades were great. Now they're not, and apart from them, my life is a mess. I need help. She was my last chance.

Edit: thank you so much for the awards!!

o5ap6o,I just had a neurologist tell me I have to learn to live with my adhd/stc instead of meds - I walked out,trontrontronmega,3384,2021-06-21 18:15:09,477,"Edit: wow so many amazing responses. I have put in a complaint. I will try take it further. I’ll update how the new one goes on the weekend. If it’s not good it looks like I’ll leave this clinic. I mean, I can’t get any more solid diagnosis with my issues. If a 50 page medical file detailing all my scans and treatment and evaluation isn’t enough I don’t know what else I can do but find somewhere else...

But I hope my complaint raises some flags and can help stop this happening to other people. We should not in any way be made to feel like adhd or any cognitive issue is made up and should be learnt to live with. Acne gets treated with medication, depression gets treated with medication - yes of course lifestyle snd therapy are also to be used in conjunction with treatment as it also helps. But adhd needs to have the same value as all these other issues and we should never be made to feel like we are crazy and don’t deserve help. 

I’ve been on this sub for a while. I’m writing this post to remind anyone who this happens to - don’t take it. 

Even with my limited options on my insurance - I won’t stop until I find someone who listens - living with adhd can be so hard and to be treated like this is not on. She was so rude and acted like I was making it all up despite having all this proof. I’ve gone through so many docs and appointments to be rejected and told no, it’s been super hard. For me to have even got a referral to my old neurologist to begin with took months and months! 

I had suspected adhd all my life since a young child, but was diagnosed a couple years back after reacting well to Adderall at a party. I went to a doc and did the evaluation etc

I went one step further and started seeing a neurologist who sent me for these great scans and got me on 10mg of Adderall. My brain scans and tests (evox) showed the severity of my adhd and that I had something called CDD/STC as well (it’s like adhd’s cousin - it can affect short term memory and make you day dream) 

My scans also showed me that I had a brain injury/concussion years ago (when I was a teen) that it has affected my front lobe area - basically between my adhd/cdd/BI - I lose stuff haha 

Anyway my old neurologist was great, he referred me to a neuropsychologist which I still can’t find one to get into due to wait times, to help me deal with my CDD/STC and ADHD better and I was finally excited about getting somewhere after a year and half of docs dragging their feet. 

Then he suddenly left I think due to a sudden illness last week and they replaced me with a new neurologist who I saw today. I was worried as it has been so hard to finally find him, you have no idea. My insurance is limited and I’ve spent a year and half trying to get this stuff sorted. No one before him could help me properly find out what was going on. The clinic reassured me this new neurologist was good. 

Now I’m not sure if I can mention names but I won’t for now, but if anyone with any form of depression or is really struggling with the adhd in NYC do not see this doctor. PM for the name

I went in, expecting her to look at my solid diagnosis from my scans to my referral to my letter my neurologist has written up very clearly stating I have severe adhd / cdd and a brain injury and have responded well to medication so far and we are trialing things and my history of meds, therapy, etc. 

I sat down and said I was thinking of either changing to another type of ADHD medication or upping my Adderall to 15mg as I have felt 10mg isn’t sufficient over the last 6 months. My old neurologist suggested 20mg and he was going to to change it at my next appointment but obviously left before we changed it. I also wanted to talk to her about a little seizure I had last week and my struggle with finding a neuropsychologist. 

The new neurologist, looked at my file and said you are an adult, stop using adhd as an excuse in life, all you people out there think you need medication - I will not give any medication to anyone over 18. I do not believe in adhd. 

I said excuse me? I mentioned my tests results, my literal brain scans that tested me while I was on Adderall and off. My brain tests that two neurologists officially diagnosed me with these in detail.

I said I have been on medication for years, how do expect me to deal with it if you won’t give me my medication? She said you just have to learn to learn to live with it like a normal person. Deal with my brain injury naturally. She said something about cantaloupe. And less stress. 

I said go fuck your self, thanks for nothing and walked out 

I went straight to the front desk and said I will put in a formal complaint later but please give me a doctor who actually believes in science and adhd - I said she should not be practising - she knew exactly what I meant and apologized and supposedly booked me in on the weekend to a neurologist who can actually help me 

I’m lucky I’m not going through a mentally hard time but I would hate for someone with adhd who is struggling to be stuck with this doctor and not feel the strength to stick up for my self like I did. Actually me a year ago would have left that room crying and feeling more fragile

rwd9uv,"Follow up post on my last post, I reported my Doctor to the medical board.",Tetragonos,3381,2022-01-04 19:47:41,341,"So in my last post on this subject I said I did not believe that my Doctor believed in ADHD. Well I got some evidence to that effect together and reported my doctor to my state's medical board. I just today got official word that they are doing a full investigation and things look good for me with just the evidence that I submitted. 

I found this out because my HMO got wind of it and I got a call from their legal department. I asked them what they expected after I demanded a new primary care physician because she didn't believe that the mental illness I have existed? They asked if I was going to drop them as health care and I told them I couldnt afford anyone else. 

So if you run into people being obtuse about ADHD in the medical field, get it in writing, Get it in your chart, Talk about it in emails, and go to your state's medical board and tell on them. We aren't petulant children we are grown ass adults (to the children in the audience petulant or otherwise your day will come). It is up to us to force the industry to oust bad actors within the community.

I had a friend who said ""Jesus you are going to ruin their life because you had a speed bump in getting your meds?"" No I am ruining their life because they are a harm to others and need to be removed from a position of power over people's health. If someone can look at test results that clearly show ADHD and decide they don't like that then they can decide that people with PTSD are just weenies or that people with diabetes need to just diet more carefully.

When I got a job out of college, I thought I was just incompetent because I could not bring myself to be interested enough in it to really learn what I needed to understand the work.  I couldn’t stop getting up from my desk to walk around the building, chat with coworkers, or get snacks.  I would waste time about 5 hours per day and then cram all my work into the last two hours.  The noise in my head has always been awful, and I have the most severe anxiety of anyone I’ve ever met.  Eventually I went back to grad school for a career I was actually interested in and was able to find some success.

I honestly always thought that ADHD didn’t really exist other than severe childhood cases and that everyone experienced life the way I did.  I spent my whole life masking because my mother was so angry and frightening that I always had to be “perfect” growing up.

I started Strattera two weeks ago, and it’s like going from trying to watch an old TV with tons of static to watching some brand new HD TV.  The noise in my head has reduced so much.  I can actually focus.  I feel happy.  My anxiety is lower.  I can actually pay attention when people are talking to me.

l8mtpg,Rewinding movies cause you forgot to WATCH THE MOVIE and then forgetting again,SpiceyStrawberries,3361,2021-01-30 06:29:40,183,"If i am watching a movie, tv show, or news briefing, I often miss something so I have to rewind it and see what happened. But then I still forget to watch/listen for that thing and I have to rewind again. I don't get this! What is my brain even doing after I rewind? I have zero drive to listen for that thing despite just rewinding. I have sometimes rewinded up to 4 times. I end up concluding that it was just not engaging enough for me to figure out what happened there. I actually want to know what happened, but the lead up didn't contain enough that interested me.

This is especially awkward when watching a movie with others. Was rewatching Breaking Bad with my husband last night. So this is a show I've already seen but I remember like nothing! Something important happened, but as usual, I forgot to watch TV while WATCHING TV!! So I ask my husband to rewind. Whoops, forgot to watch AGAIN. Rewind again. Forgot to watch. I pretend I didn't understand what happened and need to see it again when really I just forgot to watch again. One more time. Yup. No idea what happened, didn't watch it. I now have to pretend I saw what happened because nobody without ADHD would even believe this.

I listen to the news all the time too. My husband will listen while doing 5 other things and say ""wow, that's shocking!"" and I am like ""what is?"" and he's like...what they just said on the news! Oh....wasn't listening....

You might even hear from others that you're lazy or don't care enough. Maybe you think that too sometimes. You ARE enough. It takes so much energy to manage ADHD even with medication. You are doing a lot while it may appear to others you're not. Did you play video games all day and forget to eat? Did you hyper focus on learning how to build kitchen cabinets and thats why you were late for work? ADHD is a difficult thing to manage. You are doing the best you can.

lymazm,Ableism in textbooks,AwkwardTeen96,3339,2021-03-05 13:25:49,328,"Hi y’all, 

I wanted to share with you all a bit of a breakthrough I had today that I’m hoping encourages the rest of you as much as it is me. 

First, the bad news. There was a LOT of awful ableism in my textbook. Part of this post will contain examples, but it’s not the whole post and I hope you will scroll past those examples if they cause you anxiety and skip to the end. 

I’m in a psychology class right now called lifespan development. Last night I had to read a chapter in which adhd was addressed at length. I can honestly say it was some of the most harmful things I’ve read in a textbook about this sort of thing, and it just hurt. I hurt for myself, and for the larger community. Contained within the chapter were points made from outdated sources, pseudoscience, stereotypes, generalizations, and horrifically overstated claims. They said (and I quote) “children with adhd are burdens to teachers and parents”. They also literally only addressed boys / children who are boys. There’s zero mentions of adulthood adhd, nor of adhd in folks who aren’t little boys. 

They also claimed that we are over diagnosed to an extreme - like practically 90% of the time. 

They claimed that ALL people over the age of 8 or so fabricate symptoms to get an adhd diagnosis so they can fuel an addiction. They mention the addiction thing a lot. 

They also mentioned that mothers and female teachers are biased against little boys and therefore pathologize normal young male behaviors out of a place of hate/ignorance.

I can go on, but I think you get the point. It claimed to represent “both sides” of the “argument” meanwhile they literally did no such thing and made sweeping generalizations that are harmful. 


I talked to my boyfriend about it, and I told him a part of me felt I should say something to my professor but I was anxious/didn’t know if I was overreacting. 

He encouraged me to do it, and I did, despite the lightweight panic attack I had to fight. 



This morning, I got replies.

She expressed overwhelming support for our community, and made it very clear that her and I are absolutely on the same page. She went further to note why she felt I was correct and how wrong it all was. She went on to suggest that she help me take this to the publishers/authors of the textbook to make an even bigger impact. 

She then said she was going to make a new module for the class to address adhd, pseudoscience, ableism against adhd, etc and share resources so that the whole class becomes better educated and aware. She asked if I’d be willing to look at her ideas and sources and be a sounding board for her, I said yes.

This is not a “good for me” post. This is was a victory against myself and my anxiety - yes. But more than that I did this for all of you. I did this because of how much love and respect I have for our community. I hope this brightens your day.


{EDIT} : Several people have asked me for the title of the textbook. Here’s the truth as to why I did not immediately provide it at first : classic “overwhelm” lol. I was in a sh*t storm of homework and getting more likes and comments than I ever anticipated / have ever received (ABSOLUTELY NOT A COMPLAINT I HAVE SO MUCH GRATITUDE AND LOVE FOR ALL OF YOU) I was just getting super sensory overloaded on top of being with a friend at the time who was playing insanely loud video games and trying to talk to me. So a very simple request was not followed through with in as timely of a manner as I should have - I apologize. This apparently created suspicion so I want to clear that up if I can. Here’s the information for the textbook.

My professor and I have had a really hard time figuring out how to move forward since she could only find this person on LinkedIn, but I’m going to create an account and try that method (I’ve never used that site before) and see what happens.

If there was a cure for ADHD, would you take it? 

I wouldn’t, even though for many, including myself, ADHD makes life incredibly difficult in so many ways. I feel like ADHD has somewhat contributed to why I have such a bubbly personality and gives me a unique perspective on things, and I love how I have so many hobbies and passions. 

I don’t think there’s a “right or wrong” answer on something like this. Ultimately it’s up to how ADHD has affected you, but it’s an interesting hypothetical that I often think about.

Edit: I wanted to clarify that I don’t think ADHD or ADD is a personality trait. I just think it can influence or affect someone’s personality. These affects can be both positive and negative,  but I have enjoyed what many consider the “positive” affects are like the creativity and the endless amounts of energy.

Edit #2: Thank you for everyone who has been commenting. My heart goes out to everyone who have struggled so much with ADHD or ADD. Everyone’s opinions have been so enlightening and honestly it is crazy how people can have such different experiences with ADHD. I know it’s hard and sometimes we can all feel so useless and not productive but I truly believe there is always a light at the end of the tunnel. Feel free to reach out to me if you’d like someone to talk to!



Edit #3: I’m in no way trying to invalidate people’s experiences regarding ADHD. If it’s genuinely coming across that way, then I’m very sorry. I understand, and I am aware that ADHD can be detrimental to one’s life and make it nearly impossible to do the things you want to do, whatever those may be. I also understand that I may have it “easier” than other people who have ADHD or ADD, but no matter what, ADHD and ADD are challenging disorders to have, and I have had difficulties living a “normal life.” I just wanted to ask this question to see how it affects others. I don’t want it to become who has ADHD or ADD worse or hasn’t had it as bad.

igjufq,On transgender and LGBTQIA+ acceptance,sugardeath,3320,2020-08-25 13:01:35,1,"(and broadly, acceptance of experiences outside the western cis het white abled male expectation)

I can't believe I have to actually say this.  Lately we've been seeing an increase in people talking about their experiences as trans, nonbinary, gay, lesbian, ace, aro, or otherwise queer.  This is wonderful and we love to see people finding a community here!  For the most part, y'all are very incredibly accepting and that's why people keep coming here.  As expected though, we've also seen a rise in assholes who can't extend basic respect to people.

A recently deleted (by OP) post had many references to OP's partner using singular they/them pronouns.  OP clarified that this was primarily due to anonymity (and this too is a 100% legitimate usage of singular they/them) but that did not stop people from getting downright *hostile* about the simple usage of they/them to refer to a singular person.  As part of this they spread hate about transgender and specifically nonbinary people.  Bans were extended.  In the English language, singular they/them has existed for hundreds of years.  You're long overdue on catching up.

Other threads have people explicitly identifying themselves and people reacting only to that instead of what the post was actually about.  We do not tolerate any kind of hate against a person for who they are.  We try to have discussions and see if the person is just unaware, but we also do not exist to educate people about queerness.  Bans are given on sight for especially egregious assholery and if a person doubles down on their ignorance.  This is a safe space for people of any gender, sexuality, color, nationality, disability, etc.  Unfortunately we do miss some comments, so we really appreciate when the *report* button is used to bring these to our attention.

The /r/ADHD mod team is diverse.  The /r/ADHD community is diverse.  We will work to protect this and keep people feeling safe here.  We did not choose to be these ways, but *you* have the choice to hate or to accept and there is absolutely a wrong choice.

To summarize: Gay and trans and queer people have existed for the entirety of our species.  /r/ADHD will **not** tolerate any phobia or hate or questioning of people, their pronouns, or their experiences.  Other bannable offenses: racism, sexism, ableism, spreading fear and hate.  This list is not exhaustive.

My previous therapist left, so I was assigned a new one and this was my first appointment with him. He's a super nice guy, went to the same college I did, spent a lot of time in the town I now work in, so he's easy to connect with. Obviously a huge plus. 

We covered all of the usual stuff, diagnosed as an adult, how my childhood was, medications I've been on, what's worked, what hasn't, etc. We started talking about how I was put on Adderall, then taken off 6 months later because of blood pressure concerns, and he asked if that was a route I wanted to revisit. I told him that out of the medications I've been on, Adderall had the most positive affects, but I was open to anything. He told me he'd have to run it by his supervisor and we'd go from there.

He left and came back 10 minutes later, supervisor leading the way. She started the conversation off stating she agreed with my family doctor's decision to take me off Adderall. Fine. Understandable. Hypertension is a serious concern, I'm not about to argue that matter. The problem is, she never actually brought up blood pressure at all. She agreed with my doctor's decision, and went immediately into a spiel about how Adderall is a controlled substance for a reason, they virtually never prescribe Adderall or any other stimulant ADHD medication for adults, and adults typically only seek stimulant medications for the euphoric high that they provide, which is similar to meth or other street drugs. The entire time she stared me down with obvious accusation in her eyes.

So this is the same facility I've been going to in the past, the same one who was prescribing me, an adult, Adderall just earlier this year. The issue is, now that I've gotten my blood pressure taken care of and I'm curious about the possibility of going back on the medication THEY WERE GIVING ME, I'm clearly now a drug addict trying to score a controlled substance. So that feels great. Anyways, I'm going to try Wellbutrin and definitely find a new behavioral health facility, because being accused of that feels fucking terrible.

m4motw,Trying to explain ADHD to someone that doesn't have it is impossible.,TheAlmightyRook,3304,2021-03-13 19:19:58,264,"Every struggle that we have can be a shared experience to almost anyone that doesn't have the disorder. Short term memory, procrastination, forgetfullness, impulsivity, distractability, racing thoughts, brain fog, RSD, insomnia, mental fatigue, zoning out, anxiety, guilt, shame, rambling, time blindness, interrupting, low self-esteem, depression, starting but not finishing, to name a few.

The problem is trying to explain to people that our intentions do not match these struggles. I didn't intend on waiting until the last minute to start a task. I didn't intend on being late. I didn't intend on misplacing my keys. I didn't intend on forgetting about the meeting today. I didn't intend to spend an hour making a sandwich. I didn't intend on not responding to your text for 3 monthd.

It literally haunts our *every* action and thought. We believe ourselves to be broken individuals because of the confliction between how our mind operates vs how the world around us operates.

Our disorder is downplayed because of the frequency of our struggles in *other people's* lives. A one-off moment in your life is my entire day. ""I misplaced my keys and showed up 15 mins late this morning, must have been an A-D-D moment"" is just like saying ""my leg fell asleep today for 10 mins, must have been a paraplegic moment."" 

**It is incredibly insulting to mock a serious disorder because the symptoms are universal.**

Don't feel bad because others are ignorant and choose to be so. You are so much more than your disorder. You are a fish that is expected to climb a tree. Fuck that, swim your ass off. Be exactly who you are, everyone else is taken. You aren't broken, others are incredibly insensitive. Zone out the haters and doubters.

Do yourself a favor. Surround yourself with people that accept you for who you are, not for who they expect you to be. You are so awesome for making it this far in a world not made for you. You are stronger than you have ever been told. Learn to love, laugh at, and forgive yourself. You have what it takes. You can do this. I believe in you.

13rgy1h,Things that suck about ADHD that nobody talks about:,Used-Grapefruit-923,3295,2023-05-25 05:50:26,628,"1. Never being able to fully take in information: my brain just refuses. When someone asks me to look at an excel spread sheet and make sense of the information in it, I just shut down.

2. Which brings me to point two. Impulsively deciding what is and is not important. Like sometimes I’ll email a piece of work to my manager knowing full well that I have not read all the information but my mind is too jumpy to sit an comb through everything in order. Actually this sometimes even leads to me reading things from top to bottom or just hopping around hoping to find importance somewhere in the body of text.

3. Being so foggy that you feel out of touch with reality. With yourself. With your emotions that sometimes you can’t even understand how you feel, why you feel that way and how to change it.

4. Getting the ick. I don’t know if this is ADHD specifically but I get the ick so easily from people I actually like and have feelings for. Then I find it impossible to know how I feel about them because my emotions are now all over the place because of something so stupid.

5. Feeling self disgust. I am so tired of myself and my ways that I sometimes feel repulsed. I hate that I’m sensitive, I hate that I’m moody, I hate that I feel like I’m always underperforming, I hate that I always think everyone hates me after one wrong look or flat text message.

6. Never realising your true potential. When I’m on meds I am amazed by how much I can actually achieve. How nice I am capable of being, how much energy I have to be fit and eat healthy. 

7. The exhaustion. Mental and physical. The tiredness lies somewhere deep within my bones. 

8. Cutting corners to stay above water but feeling like a fraud. I have always had to find easier ways of doing things to stay ahead with minimal effort but this has always made me feel like a cheater and a fraud.

I found a new place and emailed the admin and get a quick reply stating that they are accepting new patients and asking if I am looking for therapy or medication management.

But I didn’t shower for over a month. I didn’t brush my teeth. I didn’t wash my hair. I didn’t change clothes too, I wear the same clothes for a month (because I don’t do laundry for almost a year, so I run out of clean clothes).

(TLDR at the end of the post)

I did feel dirty. I did feel smelly and I stink! My family and neighbors couldn’t stand to be near me because they could smell my gross body. I couldn’t sleep soundly because my skin is very sticky and very dirty. And of course my entire family is complaining. But for some reason, I never be able to get myself to the shower.

**Instead, I mindlessly scroll Facebook and Reddit, that's what I did all day, every single day. My screentime is above 10 hours a day.**

I feel like showering is a very huge and daunting task. Where I live is not that cold. It’s rather hot actually. **But I guess I'm super stressed and anxious because of my university assignments for the last one month, so even the hot weather is not enough to bring myself to the shower.**

Everytime I promised I was going to shower tomorrow noon, it never happened. So today I just said, ""F*ck it, I'm gonna shower at 9 AM!"".

I felt like showering is waste of time even when I wasted my time anyway doing other junk activities. I should be doing my tasks and school work, but I avoid that, too. I felt too dirty and stink. But I also didn't shower either. **I felt so paralyzed by this EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION!** 😭

**I don't have time to procrastinate on this anymore. Because I'm falling sooo behind on my assignments, and I couldn't do anything before I shower. But I couldn't shower either, because I'm so stressed with the mountain of work I should be doing. Perpetual cycle.** I’m so so disappointed with myself!

Anyone else struggling with showering?

How do you get yourself to the shower even when you don't feel like it? Or even when you are very stressed and anxious about failing your classes?

**EDIT**

When I was 18, I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD, or clinical depression).

When I was 23, I was diagnosed with ADHD.

Tried all those hyped up productivity systems and failed miserably every time. Made me feel even worse about myself tbh.

Finally found some weird approaches that actually work with my brain instead of against it. Nothing groundbreaking, just stuff that stuck:

* Body doubling has been shockingly effective. I use Focusmate for important tasks after a friend recommended it and suddenly I can work for 50 mins straight without checking my phone 600 times.
* The ""ugly first draft"" approach for work projects. I tell myself I'm TRYING to make it terrible on purpose, which somehow bypasses my perfectionism paralysis.
* Deleting social apps from my phone during workdays. Can reinstall on weekends. The friction of having to reinstall stops most of my impulsive checking. Tried the social media blocking apps but they never stuck, so I just delete them directly myself now.
* Found this Inbox Zapper app that helped me clear out a bunch of daily junk emails so I'm not facing one giant overwhelming list. My inbox used to give me legit anxiety, now it's much quieter
* Switched from to-do lists to time blocking. Lists made me feel like a failure when I couldn't finish them. Now I just move blocks around instead of carrying over undone tasks. I still go back to my Todoist app every once in a while for specific things, just not as my main tool.
* ""Weird body trick"" - keeping a fidget toy AND gum at my desk. Something about the dual stimulation helps me focus way better on calls.
* Stopped forcing myself to work when my meds wear off. Those last 2 hours of the day are now for mindless admin tasks only.

I did not expect this post to get so big and I'm extremely grateful for all of the amazing positive feedback! I just want to add that I am NOT advocating for relying 100% on medication and I do still have to put in the work to stay focused and not lose hours of my day. I still have many symptoms of ADHD that I can only control on my own! I am very safe with my medication and try to take an off-day twice a week. As for those still struggling, I'm here for you and hope you get the help you need soon! This was not to rub it in ANYONE'S face but to share my story!!!

For 23 years I was told by psych after psych that ADHD and social anxiety was not a good enough diagnosis in itself, and that I must have something else along with it. I live in a pretty conservative pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps area of the US and was told to exercise, focus, and maybe try meditation or yoga. I was always offered a prescription for Strattera and mood stabilizers with no other options - just take it or leave it. Even bringing up the possibility of trying a stimulant would cause an eyeroll from doctors.

At the time I found this sub, I was ready to give up. I remember crying my eyes out because of all the posts about seeing people doing so much better after trying medication, and wishing that a doctor would allow me to have that chance. The people here motivated me to keep trying and not give up on finding the right care team who would not only help me find medication, but also listen to me.

Every doctor in this area, and even my own family, SWORE that I could not have ADHD. For the dumbest reasons, too:

""You're too smart""

""You're too young to be on stimulants""

""...hyperactivity? You sleep all day!""

""The ADHD is caused by bipolar disorder. Adults don't have ADHD alone""

""I can't give you a stimulant because you could lose too much weight"" (I'm obese though? lol)

and many more...

I didn't give up though. I knew the mood stabilizers and SSRIs were not doing anything. And Strattera was essentially a sugar pill to me. I jumped from doctor to doctor. Each one of them agreeing that I had symptoms of ADHD but insisting that I was bipolar.

I started speaking up for myself. I started reading everything I could about mental health. I was firm in telling them that I did not believe I had bipolar disorder and it made no sense considering I don't have an issue with depression or mania. I started refusing the Strattera, with one doctor even telling me that it could take OVER A YEAR for Strattera to kick in when it still wasn't working after 8 months.

Finally, it happened. I went to a new doctor. She almost laughed at the fact that I kept being diagnosed as bipolar with no real signs of it. She was SHOOK at the fact that none of these doctors offered any other medication for ADHD and that my anxiety was ignored. She prescribed me Vyvanse that day and asked me to come back in two weeks.

My life changed that day. When I first went into her office I was failing school, unable to work, obese, unable to remember anything, all tasks being difficult to complete, picking my skin, constantly being tired, and maladaptive daydreaming for hours a day.

**What happened after medication:**

That Vyvanse, along with finding a care team that listens to me, **got me my first 4.0 ever this past** **semester**, despite COVID switching all my classes to online. It made me to **start eating healthy again**. It made me **enjoy decorating my home and keeping it clean**. It made me enjoy **working out**. It made me wake up **feeling refreshed in the morning**. It made me **realize I'm a fantastic** **programmer**. It got me **back into playing music and video games**. It got me a **cyber security internship**. It helped me **remember to reply to my friends and family, which has strengthened our connection.** Oh, and I **stopped picking my skin for the first time since I was 6 years old!!**

The other who doctors didn't listen to me or didn't ""believe"" in ADHD told me I would get addicted to meth, become underweight, and have terrible reactions to stimulants without taking mood stabilizers or anti-psychotics. They refused to look at my ADHD as a valid diagnosis alone.

**Basically, what I'm saying is to please not give up**. **If you are from a close-minded town, have a family who doesn't take you seriously, or your doctor refuses to try other forms of treatment, there is still a way for you to overcome these obstacles. Stay strong. Pay attention to how YOU feel. Be an advocate for yourself.**

I struggled with these things for years and while it hasn't fixed all my issues (social anxiety is still p bad) it has helped change me into the human I wanted to be. And I'm not even done yet.

A few years ago, she revealed that she thought I'd never be able to hold down a job.

Soon after that I discovered that when I was a teenager, and it was apparent that I was failing to deliver on the intellectual promise that I'd appeared to possess, it was suggested to my parents that I should see a psychiatrist. 

They decided not to 'because they thought it would make me worse'.

I was finally diagnosed in my mid-40s.

Today, my Alzheimers-stricken mother, who is running on about 5% battery, found the energy to apologise for not doing a better job raising me.

'I'm sorry,' she said. Having never been able to remotely engage in any conversation that touched on mental, psychological or emotional turmoil previously, she somehow roused herself to connect in a way I'd never experienced before.

And I reassured her that she'd always done her best, that she was very kind, and that she'd tried to take care of me.

Because, within the limits of what she was capable of, she had. She understood my asthma, it was tangible, so she hoovered the house to get rid of the dog hair when I came home after moving away.

She never understood the invisible things I was suffering with.

I think she mostly just assumed I was stubborn and lazy and I would eventually grow out of it.

I’m 25 now and I feel like not being medicated early on in life has set me back in so many ways. I struggle to keep up with simple tasks like brushing my teeth everyday or making sure I drank water at least once. I’ve been working on the same associate’s degree for like 3 years and barely made any progress because taking more than two classes at a time is a monumental struggle. I still live with my grandparents.

I try to give myself props for little victories. Like, “hey girl, you brushed your teeth today and put in lotion and brought the cups down from your room that have been sitting there for a week, good for you!” But it’s hard when you see people around you getting the “big victories”. 

Ya know, the house, the car, the job, the new baby and the new marriage.

I know I need to be medicated but even just calling to make the appointment to see a physician is like some impossible, other worldly task. It really sucks and it’s so hard to convey this sort of struggle to neurotypical people.

For years, my sole exception was chefs knives. I've heard from various people that the dishwasher is hard on knives, especially good quality ones. This was a problem because it meant I'd just fill my sink with knives to ""wash later"" until I ran out.  

But surely this couldn't have been good for them either, so a few years ago I raised the question to a group of cooking enthusiasts...
""What's worse for knives? The dishwasher, or leaving them dirty in the sink for days on end?""  

Almost universally, the response was ""what the hell is wrong with you? Just take 15 seconds to wash the knife."" This sentiment is echoed in many places online as well.  

A useless answer. So I decided, fuck it. I'm doing it the easy way and whatever happens to the knives happens.

ffctgf,"ADHDers need to take ""the third door""",matinmuffel,3245,2020-03-08 06:54:08,327,"I learned this concept last night and wanted to share.

You can think of success in life like a club we're all trying to get into. Most people will go in the front door. They stand in line, wait their turn, and work their way forward slowly but surely. A select number of exclusive people get to use the back door, the are the people who know the right person, have the right reputation, or could buy their way in. But some people can't get in through the front or the back door, they need ""the third door""

The third door is the unmarked way in. It's a window, a fire escape, a roof exit. It's hiding in the laundry cart when they bring in the linens or disguising yourself and going in the service entrance. It's a combination of timing, ingenuity, and effort, but you can keep trying until you make it in. 

I often need to remind myself that my route to success is different, but that doesn't make it any less real. The whole concept of ""run your own race"" has been reiterated to me so many times but I find it hard to stop comparing my path to others. I have to remind myself: just keep trying things, never stop innovating ways around your problems, fall down nine times and stand up ten. I think I feel my best when I'm in ""lovable rogue"" mode, because I know I don't feel good (at all!!!) when I'm in ""trying to be normal"" mode. 

Find your third door, people. 

And remember, if you get into ""the club"" - you aren't a fraud, you deserve to be there just as much as anybody else.

EDIT: Holy moly this resonated! Please everybody keep sharing your stories and experiences. Maybe we all need to see/remember the breadth of possibility that's truly out there.

I have nothing to add to this article, only thought that a lot of people here would appreciate reading it because of the side evidence that ADHD and Autism both have genetic causes. 

It also shows why symptoms vary so widely between ADHD people. Because it's not linked to just one gene expression, but to several different ones that also modify cognitive abilities and other things. And this is just the tip of the iceberg, there could be even more still that they'll find with more research.

""Researchers have also discovered a gene variant that increases the chance of autism while also decreasing the volume of a particular brain region in the general population, but the complementary variant raises the risk of ADHD while also increasing the volume of the same brain area.""

It's nice to finally have an answer to the question ""Why do so many ADHD people have so many different symptoms"".

Edit: Guys, please don't depression / trauma dump on me. Heres a quick list to answer all the pessimistic questions.

1. No this will not create a cure. It isn't about finding a cure, it's about finding a cause so doctors stop going ""well you __ so you can't be ADHD"".

2. Yes there's always the risk of rich people at some point in the distant future using this as a way to make Designer Babies. But that's going to happen anyway so using that worry as a reason to not research the important genetic things is not a good idea.

3. I'm sorry if you don't like the article title, please send a letter to the paper instead of telling me.

4. No this is not about new genetics, it's about newly *discovering* the genetics. The genetics have existed for centuries, we just didn't have the technology to figure them out until now.

5. Many of y'all have forgotten how even *basic* genetics works and it shows. Look up ""genetically recessive"" or go read other comments, I'm tired of explaining it over and over again.

6. This article is *just one possible cause of ADHD*. The discovery of one possible cause does not mean that it's the *only* cause. Stop getting mad at me over this.

7. If y'all are confused *go read other comments* and stop asking me to explain it.

To everyone else, I'm glad this article helped you feel better about yourself, feel validated, or otherwise improved your mental state today.

1) Wanting to do everything at once and getting overwhelmed and not doing anything.

2)Getting a new hobby, focusing on it and then leaving it pretty soon after.

3)Brain won't shut off. Very hard time trying to fall asleep.

But there’s something really important to remember. Granted, I see this much more on Facebook than Reddit, but I think it’s important here too. 

If you ask a group of ADHD people “do you do x” and a bunch of them say “yes” it’s easy to conclude that surely x is an ADHD thing. 

And sometimes it is. There are a ton of things that can be connected to ADHD. 

But it could just as easily be a trait that’s common in a comorbidity, a trait that’s common to trauma, or a trait that’s really common in people in general. 

So instead of simply noticing “hey, a lot of ADHD people do x” it’s important to think “how, if at all, is this related to ADHD?”

Again, a lot of things really are related to ADHD. And some things the evidence is inconclusive. So there are some things where the answer is “this might be related, but we aren’t sure.” 

Just please remember to ask and answer questions carefully.

Edit: Enough people have asked about my second qualm. I wasn’t going to say it because it’s irrelevant here. But…

Basically my other qualm is the way some people try to force the “positives of ADHD” narrative. 

I’ve had people insist to me that I’m wrong about myself. That I must be creative, that I must be good in a crisis, that I must be good at coming up with ideas, that I must be spontaneous, that surely my hyperfocus must benefit me, etc because that’s how ADHD people are.

The supermarket is 15 min from my town, again only going there because the coupon gives me the cheapest price at this specific place. I said yes that’s my current address… she comes back over to me and says that she has to report me to the DEA (I’m in NY for reference). I was processing what she was saying (I also haven’t taken my meds in a week because I was out, I don’t even take them everyday because my doctor told me there’s no need to when I’m not working, so I usually don’t even renew them at the 30 day mark, maybe a week or so later). I asked her why she would need to do that and she goes “there are about 16 pharmacies between here and where you live so it’s a red flag that you would come here”. I was quiet. I said this is the cheapest place to get my medications and she kind of just stared at me. She also shouted something about how she has to report it because I’m getting a narcotic, in front of everyone, which I’m pretty sure is a hipaa violation? 

Not sure if this matters, but felt I should mention, I have teal hair and literally had just rolled out of bed to get my meds so that I could start working at 11am. Helping people with their mental health issues. Only to be discriminated against for trying to work on my own.


***update I spoke with the manager of the store twice, he kept telling me he’s “sorry” I felt she was judging or accusing me. He said there is a new questionnaire they are utilizing that started 10 days ago when someone is picking up a controlled substance. I reiterated this was BEYOND a line of questioning, as I am a health care worker and have an awareness of how to speak to people and pick up on how people speak to me. He just kept saying he was sorry, and I said and the fact that she SHOUTED that I was picking up a narcotic like other posters said could potentially put me in a dangerous situation to be robbed as I am going to my car.  He did say “she shouldn’t have said that” I asked for another number or someone I could speak to in corporate and he said “I kind of am corporate” I’m like well I can take this further if you don’t want to give me someone else to speak to you. Waiting on him to call me back with a “number”

Also a fellow redditor was able to supply me with the corporate contact of customer service and pharmacy services. I will be sending a formal complaint via email :)",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/udlll4/pharmacist_said_theyre_reporting_me_to_the_dea/,True,False

qn74rr,Boyfriend just told me he thinks I'm exaggerating the extent to which ADHD affects my life and asked me to convince him he doesn't have ADHD as a result :/,rhi_ing231,3201,2021-11-05 02:13:46,725,"Idek what to do, man. He was supportive of my diagnosis and my attempt to get medication some time soon, but when I was saying I get bored with exercising even because I liked it, he suggested exercising while watching a show, to which I said I couldn't bc if my ADHD and explained why.

Then he just kinda had that smug ""Haha okay, sure"" look and I asked him why he seems to not believe I have ADHD.

When I started explaining it to him in more detail, he was like ""Oh so, you don't think I can convince a doctor I have ADHD when I don't ? I don't think ADHD is that serious"" and just kinda kept dismissing all my symptoms, my diagnosis, my lived experiences growing up with ADHD, etc etc.

I'm just... So hurt ?? I feel dismissed ??? I'm kind of starting to doubt myself ? Idk.



EDIT: Oh wow, hello y'all. I didnt expect this to get the attention it got.

All of your comments have been insightful, considering how many of you guys had similar experiences, to which I'm sorry about.

Someone here said I've probably been talking about it a lot, and in retrospect, I have. When we were kind of arguing, I said ""Do you even know what it's like to grow up convinced you're lazy and not applying yourself and all this bad shit, only to grow up and find out it wasn't me the entire time ? ADHD affects everything for the individual, and I mean everything"" and compared how he wouldn't be treating a (for lack of better term) low functioning autistic person the way he was me. When he told me to convince him he doesn't have ADHD, I even suggested getting him tested if he's so needs convincing, and that there are low income options where we are.

I guess the most frustrating part is how I know he's seen so many of my symptoms (fidgeting: biting nails, pulling hair, chewing on things / talking fast and interrupting / etc) but is still skeptical about how much of my weird ""quirks"" and messiness and such are actually ADHD. He's seen it all ! Every symptom I have, he's seen it, and I know he has because he actively tries to stop my nail biting and stuff. 

For those who are questioning his general demeanor: he really is sweet and supportive of me and everything I do, but this one thing is what he's skeptical about. I would have rather him skeptical about me doing art as a side business or something. Something small. He has supported and encouraged me in everything from my art, to my jobs, to my friends. Just why not this ?

I told him I can't expect him to understand every little bit about being in my brain, but that I at least want him to try, and that he can't dictate my experiences from a non-ADHD perspective.

I plan on talking to him about it later because after our little argument, I just took a shower and went to sleep. I was just too tired.

He has had this teacher all year, and she seemed to get worse after our 504 meeting, but in a sneaky snarky way that I couldn't pin down clearly enough to report her for. Today, she crossed a line. 

The redacted email I immediately sent to the principal and assistant principal/counselor is below. Maybe I should have waited, I don't know. But it's done. We are both processing. I'm keeping him home tomorrow. I don't know what to do next and I'm in way over my head. 

Email summary: 

Today she told the class all about how ADHD didn’t exist when she was a kid. She said ADHD is just being hyper, and that she is hyper, everyone is hyper, medication isn’t necessary and that it’s bad for you, and that all that’s needed is to adjust your sleep schedule and use natural remedies like essential oils. It’s not the first time she has talked about these natural remedies and the essential oils she takes to fight things like cancer cells, but it’s the first time she has specifically said this about ADHD. That she is saying ADHD drugs aren’t necessary and are bad for you while they are also doing a anti drug program, and talking about drugs makes it all even worse because she made them sound like the same things. After all the attention called to him needing to drink water at the beginning of the year, the whole class knows he has ADHD and takes medication. Now he thinks everyone is going to see him as a drug addict.

It’s completely inappropriate for a teacher to be pushing opinions about medical conditions or medications to a class of 5th graders who don’t even have a say in their own medical treatment and telling children that medicine isn’t necessary and they only need natural remedies is irresponsible. There was nothing to be gained by her sharing her feelings about ADHD with the class; she knows it directly applies to him and would be hurtful. He is understandably upset. He is angry but also feels ashamed and like it’s his fault somehow. We were really trying to ride out the year without needing any intervention for these problems, but this is unacceptable. Any guidance would be appreciated.

What's to prevent her from denying it or saying she said it differently? I believe him. He used specific wording when I drilled down to find out her exact words, and his telling is consistent. But he is still a kid, so it's his word vs hers unless they talk to other kids. Would they do that?

But I almost instantly fall asleep any time after 2 am. What should I do?

NT sleep advice: You, someone who cannot conceptualize time in any way whatsoever, need to identify TWO HOURS in advance when you want to sleep and, with your executive dysfunction that makes making decisions at will almost straight up impossible, make the decision to stop whatever you’re involuntarily hyperfixating on. Then, you, with a focus disorder that makes it so that you have to be doing something at all times, sit and do nothing for 2 hours. You cannot read. You cannot be on your phone. Do not move. Do not talk to people. Just sit and do nothing. If you can’t fall asleep it’s because you Did Something and it’s your fault. Bluelight 24 hours before you want to sleep is the reason. Never look at a TV, Phone, computer, OR let one of these objects be within a 24,000 mile radius of you. Never ever go NEAR your bed unless you’re already asleep. If you are AWAKE in your bedroom ever you will not be able to sleep.

**Edit: thanks for the support guys! Quite a few people have asked 1. If I have any tips and 2. What my project was on, so I figure ill answer both here:

1. A regular predictable schedule (I do better working full time and going to school then just going to school because the schedule is more rigid), taking my meds (Wellbutrin for adhd, buspirone for anxiety, Benadryl for sleep), accepting that my study habits look different than other peoples and learning to be okay with it (I study best in short bursts and lots of dopamine breaks), learning how to write papers in a way that suits me (lots of colors and fonts to keep my sources straight and filling in at outline - I obviously change the colors and fonts back before submitting it) and asking for testing accommodations for a quiet solo space. 

2. My project was on using halophytes (salt loving plants) and natural soil amendments to remediate runoff salt pollution in roadside soils before it leaches into local water channels.

11yl0cp,ADHD probably won't kill you. But Depression very well might.,sobrique,3141,2023-03-22 07:37:50,387,"To my mind, ADHD is often less of a problem than the Depression it brings to your door. 

ADHD is manageable and treatable. It's difficult, but you can live well with it, with the right support.

Depression is insidious and cruel. It kills you very slowly, by taking away all the things that make you want to continue existing. It might take years, but that road? It's self destructive, it's miserable, and at the end of it? Suicide starts to look so very reasonable and rational. 

It turns the world grey and misty. It removes bright colours and mutes emotions. It makes choices impossible, because you simply cannot summon the emotional response to decide, because you don't care. It makes you reckless. It makes you your own 'evil twin' - certain that the world would be a better place without you in it. And capable of taking steps to do precisely that. To remove yourself, and isolate yourself from people you can. And to push away the people you can't. To become a worse person, because you truly believe that it's ""better this way"". 

And after you have followed that road for long enough? You're just tired. You're exhausted. You don't _care_ and you just want everything to stop. Ironically perhaps, this may even delay you taking the 'final step', because you can't even be bothered to do that either. This is a known danger of treating serious depression - because someone _that close_ to the line, increasing their executive function and their motivation can be catastrophic. 

ADHD sows the seeds of depression. ADHD means you'll fail more, and you'll struggle more. It means you'll be mistreated by people who don't _understand_ your needs. Often inadvertently, but occasionally with cruelty and malice. And maybe you'll have difficult understanding your own needs. Why your brain doesn't let you do things that look 'simple'. 

So it's very easy to hit an ADHD induced 'failure' in your life, and be unable to forgive yourself for it, because you _don't understand_. 

And over time? Those failures will eat away at you. Maybe they'll be just little things, that other people barely noticed. Sometimes they'll be bigger things, where you _know_ you hurt someone, but you still can't understand how or why or what you did wrong. Those all add up to pieces of psychological trauma, that will stick in you like splinters, and fester until you remove them. 

But when you don't have _time_ to stop and heal, to 'extract' the splinters, they'll just stay there. Heal over, and become even harder to deal with, but still be there hurting you over and over. 

And that's where ADHD comes in again - your life is hard. You're struggling. You're fighting an invisible war. You don't have _time_ to stop and heal, and your executive function isn't working at full strength even when you do. 

So slowly, gradually, and insidiously, depression takes hold. It makes your ADHD harder to cope with - your executive function is already degraded, and depression hits that too.  And in turn, ADHD? Well, you don't have the executive function to tackle the depression either. 

It might take a very long time. It took me 20 years of gradually getting more and more depressed, as I accumulated more and more 'splinters' of failure, that wouldn't heal. I was steadily becoming my own 'evil twin'. I was a horrible person. Truly. I wish with all my heart I could say I 'didn't mean it'... but I did. I really did. My hollow justification of 'it would be better this way' as my rationale for hurting and pushing away the most amazing people in my life? Well, it's hollow. But I _believed_ it. 

So what of this? Why am saying this?

First of all - I want you all to know: I get it. I see you. I know how bad it can be. 

I know why you don't feel like you can reach out. Why you're hiding it from everyone around you. I know exactly where this road goes too. 

I also want you to know that the very first step of 'fixing' this, is the only one that's actually hard. Breaking down that wall of pride, self doubt and self worth, and admitting that you _need help_ to someone who can do that for you... and accepting that you _deserve_ that help too. 

After that first step? The rest is gentle and slow. People experienced at treating depression are _good_ at what they do. They will understand you and see you in a way your friends and family cannot. 

So if you recognise this in yourself - you don't even have to say anything right now. I just want you to know that I believe in you. I am just some guy on the internet. I have no reason to lie to you, or pretend I want you around. 

Because what I believe is that your struggles so far? They're _all_ that you need to be a worthy person. You are fighting an invisible war. Other people don't know or understand. But I do. I get it. Your will to go on makes you magnificent. You've fought every day, and kept going into the darkness, with no end in sight. And you're tired. I get that too. 

But the world truly would be a lesser place if you did succeed in removing yourself from it. There's a shortage of beautiful people, and one fewer would be a shame. 

And what I'd like you to do - if all this resonates - is to take that small, but oh so hard first step. Reach out to someone who can help you, and make them understand that you _need_ it. 

Do it for me, if you can't do it for you. Some guy you will never meet, who will never judge you, but that believes you are a beautiful worthy person, who makes the world better by being there. A person who believes that you _deserve_ to be happy, and that you _can_ be happy.

ADHD won't go away, it's part of what makes you who you are. It's part of what makes you beautiful. But without the depression dragging you down, it's absolutely possible to live well with ADHD.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/11yl0cp/adhd_probably_wont_kill_you_but_depression_very/,True,False

I am not diagnosed with ADHD, but after struggling with concentration and getting things done in time a psychologist suggest that my problems sound a lot like ADHD.
Anyway, I was a bit perplexed at first but after doing some research and also reading a lot of posts here, the descriptions really resonated with me.
The latest symptoms that really fascinated me were emotional dysregulation and rejection sensitivity. I have always felt like I was more sensitive to criticism and even when I knew it was well-intentioned and constructive, I immediately became defensive, angry and couldn’t let go of it, even after a while. Still I always tried my best to never publicly show any “bad” emotions. I don’t get angry or yell, I never cry in front of others. 
Then, recently I watched a YouTube video by How to ADHD on emotional dysregulation, and it was mentioned that children with ADHD get reprimanded for strong emotional responses much more and develop strategies such as repressing emotions, avoiding uncomfortable situations and being a people pleaser early on.
It reminded me that as a child I was very emotional and would extremely angry which was not in proportion to the situation. (I once smashed a plate with a spoon when I was 7 because I didn’t want to eat more broccoli. I was also a very sore loser.)But the shitty part is that I remember this instances because my family kept telling these stories and finding them hilarious. Every time they would tell a story, I felt guilty and ashamed.
I am sure that they didn’t mean to hurt me but the whole situation is pretty fucked up now that I think about it.
I am trying to unlearn that behavior now and letting myself be okay with showing emotions but it’s not easy.

To better yourself and succeed at something you should devote 1% of your day to that thing (whatever it is) and 1% of your day is only 14 minutes. Or something like that. 

Anyways, taking it a bit out of context my brain held on to the realization that 1% of my whole day is only 14 minutes. Something I hate doing is cleaning, so instead of leaving the cleaning as the daunting huge task that my brain feels like I have to finish if I start it, why not just devote 14 minutes each day to cleaning. 14 minutes and then we are done. No need to finish cleaning everything, just clean as much as possible in 14 minutes. 

Well, I got home and tried it. I set a timer for 14 minutes and cleaned as much as I could in 14 minutes. When the timer went off, I stopped. My house is already cleaner than it was, noticeably. I intend to do the same thing tomorrrow. Only 14 minutes. No more, no less. I am excited to see how much cleaner it feels tomorrow after two days of only devoting 1% of my day to it. 

I think it’s helpful because I don’t need to clean a whole room, or a whole area to completion to feel successful. 

Anyways, I would love to have some of you try this alongside of me if you’re up for it. Kind of like a challenge but I guess just pick the one thing you want to do but just can’t because it’s a daunting task and only do it for 14 minutes - see how much you can get done.

p6kf5h,"Most people think ADHD is ""SQUIRREL!"" what it is actually is me showing up to the gym in a gaudy pink and green cat themed tank top impulsed purchased last year because all my workout clothes are dirty and piled in the laundry basket. Also wearing dress shoes cause I forgot to switch.",Lost_And_Found66,3112,2021-08-17 21:53:42,126,"
Why is this in ""success"" do you ask? Well because in order for all my athletic wear to be dirty it means I've been consistently making time for working out instead of getting distracted by my phone or whatever else I do that somehow taken away from my available time to work out (I truly don't know where most of my hours go). Also, because I used this horrific hideous tank top I wasted money on for the first time in over a year. Impulse purchases are always gonna happen for me. My medication makes it better but it is inevitable but I see actually getting some use out of it as a net positive. And the biggest success is even though I was wearing horribly inappropriate shoes to work out, I didn't turn around go home and give up. I did what excercises I could without destroying my feet (mostly upper body weight lifting) and then afterwords came home switched into my sneakers and went for a run around town for a little bit. 



I think why I'm so happy is that my life is objectively still not ""together"" but this is a win on so many levels for my ADHD brain. A lot of people I know would look at this as me messing up and not being the best I could be. I see this as progress and me being better than I've been.

Man so much of my past pain was a result of untreated ADHD as a kid. Being basically scolded as a waste of potential and talent all the time. Standing outside of the classroom in 3rd grade, crying, fucking terrified to go inside because I didn’t do my math homework again. And it wasn’t because I didn’t care, or because I was lazy. Getting mediocre grades when I valued how I did in school. Getting slapped because I didn’t hang my clothes and instead threw them on the ground whenever I’d change. So much fear, frustration, sadness, and anger I experienced. Which no doubt manifested itself as anxiety and depression.

ulyby8,"Said goodbye to my pet snake today. Don't buy exotic animals, kids.",ICantExplainItAll,3085,2022-05-09 11:53:02,620,"In an impulsive burst I dropped more than $2k on snake supplies and a ball python when I was 18. I thought it was gonna be amazing, and I'd have this cool pet forever. It turns out snakes aren't like puppies and some don't like to be handled at all. Also they eat rats. RATS BRO.

I held out and kept this guy alive for almost 5 years but I slowly started neglecting it more and more, taking more time between tank cleanings, water changes, feedings... I'm grateful that they're hardy enough that I didn't murder this snake.

I kept trying to rehome him but I did not have the executive function to make listings and follow through with them, and find a good home for him to go to. Plus I felt guilty about the possibility of handing him over to just another owner like me who would pay attention to him for six months then neglect him for 30 years.

But today I got up, took double my meds, and packed up all his stuff and surrendered him to a local exotic animal rescue. I was a little sad, but ultimately he's gonna be taken way better care of there than he ever will with me.

Now I can clear some space and energy and maybe get a dog. I think that will be a little more my speed. And I don't have to keep jumbo rats in my freezer anymore.

Word of advice: exotic animals aren't as cool of a pet as you think they're gonna be. They have a lot of unconventional needs, and most reptiles don't make any noise and so you can accidentally forget they exist for a month. Or more. Oh god. Thank fuck he's safe now.

Edit: Oh the comments!! Thanks for all the replies!! I'm reading through all of them right now and wanna say some things

Re: getting a dog - I've owned two dogs in the past and was a good dog owner. They both lived long very happy lives. The problem with owning a snake is that it doesn't remind you of it's existence. Dogs will approach you and alert you to their needs. Plus they have a daily routine vs. a snake that needs to be fed once a month. It's easy to forget when was the last time you fed a snake when it was 28 days ago.

My boyfriend also has been a dog owner and will split the responsibility with me. He just had no idea how to take care of a snake and so couldn't help me. Part of his feeding was going across town to the one pet store that sold dead rats under the table (ew) which is a much higher motivation requirement than buying 45 lbs of dog food on Amazon.

However! I do appreciate the concern. You guys are right that a pet is a commitment regardless of the type of pet. I am not going to pick up a puppy tomorrow. But giving away my snake was the first step to me considering if a dog will fit in in my life and daily routine. I wouldn't consider the possibility while having another pet that was neglected in the house.

Also yeah I want a cat badly. I've wanted one my whole life and agree they're more independent. But my boyfriend is sadly stupidly allergic.

I'm gonna read through all the comments and reply over the next day inbetween errands. Love this sub and again really appreciate the time you guys take to give advice.

Second edit: Alright I get it. You guys act like I'm pet Hitler or something. My snake was a healthy weight when I surrendered him and didn't have problems with shedding or eating which are two hallmark signs of an unhealthy reptile. Neglect was too strong a word. I meant more emotional neglect. I stopped being excited by his existence. I started dreading feeding times. I hated trying to handle a pet who clearly hated it. But. He. Is. Alive. I recognized my limitations BEFORE it started affecting his health. Damn. I went to this sub for understanding - I once saw a post about a pet hamster baking to death in the sun that got a more sympathetic response!

And the double dose was fine. My psychiatrist recommended I try it if I felt like my dose wasn't enough. I'm on the starting dose of 10mg of instant release Ritalin and she said to try taking two after a while and seeing if I liked it better. I didn't think I'd have to argue for my life in the ADHD sub of all places.

We make mistakes you guys. I've been a great dog owner in the past. And damn!! It was one sentence!! In the middle of a post!! About something else! You guys really latched onto it.

13vowqc,"The desire to just exist, without expectations or obligations",eugval,3084,2023-05-30 05:27:03,323,"Like many of you, I struggle with task initiation, prioritisation, follow-through, and memory. Sometimes, I struggle to summon up the energy and self-will to do an activity I want to do and that I enjoy, never mind one that I have to do and actively hate. The only thing that really helps is having other people around (a sense of community, body doubling, accountability, and all that), but this isn't a method that can be relied upon all or even most of the time.

I'm currently not enjoying my work environment and I struggle to engage with anything I have to do there. I want to look for a new job, but it's taken me over a month to mostly finish getting a CV together, never mind doing any actual applications. I need to send off my passport for renewal; I need to write an email to my landlady; I have to successfully feed and clothe myself every day and attempt to keep my flat somewhat clean and tidy; I have to reply to my messages and keep up my relationships... It goes on and on and on, with no end in sight. There's always something else, always another thing you're supposed to be doing.

I know for a fact I'm burnt out at work, but sometimes I feel like I'm burnt out by life itself. When you try to explain to people, they say ""Oh, maybe you just need a holiday"" - what they don't understand is that while, yes, I will enjoy myself on holiday and have a good time, everything that stresses me out will still be here when I get back, plus whatever else has come up while I've been away. It would only work if someone else took over my life while I was gone and cleared the task backlog for when I got back!

What I really want is the ability to just exist. To be able to live life without expectations or obligations placed on me, to be able to engage with the things that I want to do, and to be able to avoid the things I don't. I wish I could live in a commune of some kind where I didn't have to worry about taxes and insurance payments and planning for the future; where someone else, who is better at and/or enjoys those things more than I do, takes care of that for me. The only semi-realistic option I have seen is to get to a level of wealth where you can have an assistant to take care of it all for you, but I don't know if I will ever be able to summon the drive and consistency to be able to get up to that level.

I know that building habits and good support systems can help take the burden off, but I never feel like I have enough spare energy after the drudgery of everyday life to start to work towards those things on anything larger than the smallest of scales e.g. getting bowl by the door for my keys so I stop losing them. Consistent, long-term work towards a self-set goal feels... impossible. 

I am medicated, and I find that while it helps with attention span, concentration, and short-term memory, it does little to bridge the gap into finding the motivation for working on long-term tasks with no immediate payoff.

I guess I mostly just wanted to rant in a platform where I actually feel understood, but also to see who else in our lovely community has similar sentiments, and who might have an insight or advice for how to combat this feeling of... existential burnout, I guess?

There's a moment that everyone reaches where they think, ""I want to get off of my phone"". For people with ADHD that thought can arrive a lot later than,  ""I should probably get off of my phone"", because you end up getting stuck dopamine-fishing.

As soon as you start to feel the slightest bit of desire or need to get off of your phone:


- Close your eyes. 

That's it. Just close them. Being on your phone is such a visual stimulus. Get rid of the visuals. It's just you and your thoughts. If there's audio playing on your device, you're on hard-mode, but you can still do it,  I believe in you. 



- While your eyes are closed, turn off your phone screen. You dont have to power the phone all the way off, although that helps- you just have to turn the screen off. 


My next step is to usually chuck my phone across the room because I have full faith in my otterbox, but I mean, you can hold onto it if you want. 


The most important part is the next step:



- Focus on standing up. 

This is difficult because your attention is competing with whatever you were just doing on your phone,  and you're going to feel tempted to resume your phone activities. This is why it helps if you can power your phone off with your eyes closed. Your eyes should still be closed. 


Silence the noise in your brain by counting to 10 and thinking about both of your feet being on the ground.  Think about being an individual that's standing up. It may seem silly to break down getting up like this, but the idea is to break away from the magnet that is your bed/ chair/comfort area. 


Tbh sometimes I just slump onto the floor like a worm, which works sometimes, but sometimes I just end up laying on the floor for another 40 minutes. That's why it's important to think about being standing,  and not just ""out of bed"". If I'm not careful, I end up in another location, stuck in the same rut. 



- Bonus step:


Once you're standing, repeat a mantra of what you want to be doing,  followed by ""it's easy"".
For example,  ""I'm gonna take the clothes out of the dryer, it's pretty easy"". You're pigeon-holing your focus onto one task,  and your reminding yourself that what you want to do is doable, and that you're capable. 

If you're in an internal battle of which task you want to do, just go with whatever is the first **relevant** one that you blurt of your mouth. No need to consider any further than that.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/of7rsf/how_to_get_off_your_phone_and_get_out_of_bed/,True,False

\- Tracking the time I spend on every single activity in my life using excel sheets (from tasks at work, to going to the toilet or even time spent playing with my cat).→Got completely exhausted after two days.

\- Tracking all the calories, water and caffeine I consume, as accurately as possible. →Wasted so much time trying to figure out the exact number of calories in everything my gf and I cook.

\- Buying a fitness tracker to collect as much data as possible about myself (this was actually a good thing in the long run, once I stopped being obsessed with refreshing the app every five minutes).

\- Impulsively downloading countless of apps and programs that track different aspects of what I do on my computer or phone. Impulsively deleting most of them after a while.

\- Writing down at the end of the day everything I could remember. (Brain goes completely blank when I try to do this).

Current attempt: I started using exist.io and linked as many data sources I have that don't require me to actively track stuff (except for my mood and a few tags at the end of the day).

Do you guys have similar obsessions? I think this ends up doing more harm than good every time I try. Is there a healthy way for people with ADHD to track stuff without getting overwhelmed?

Edit: I didn't expect this to be so relatable to so many people because I really couldn't find a post about being obsessed with time tracking when I searched this subreddit, so thank you all for sharing your experience. This means a lot to me, really. Here's a list of words that have at some point been a important part of my life for a very short time, that might make you gasp in ""relatableness"": Fitbit, Todoist, Toggl, Clockify, Strava, Sleep Cycle, daily journaling, a spreadsheet containing all the books I own, a Python program used to create that spreadsheet by scanning barcodes, more time spent tracking stuff than actually doing stuff, more time talking or writing about tracking stuff than actually doing stuff, eating the same meals every day to optimize food tracking, trying to find a nutritionally complete liquid meal to substitute every meal with, trying to set a fixed number of tasks to tackle every day (no more, no less), etc.

Manuscript DOI: 10.1080/13811118.2020.1856258

A nationally representative Canadian study reported that the lifetime prevalence of suicide attempts was much higher for women who had ADHD (24%) compared to women who had not (3%). Men with ADHD were also more likely to have attempted suicide compared to men without ADHD (9% vs. 2%)

Because ADHD is more common among men than among women, little research or clinical attention has focused on women with the disorder. In this study, women with ADHD had more than twice the odds of suicide attempts compared to men with ADHD.

Adults with ADHD who had been exposed to chronic parental domestic violence had triple the odds of suicide attempts compared to their peers with ADHD who had not experienced that childhood adversity. Parental domestic violence was defined as ""chronic"" if it had occurred more than 10 times before the respondent was age 16.

“We speculate that violent parental conflict may cause extreme stress for the child with ADHD and predispose these individuals to mental illness and suicidal thoughts. In addition, the challenges of raising a child with ADHD who is struggling with severe mental health issues may cause parental conflict, which may escalate into domestic violence.""

The study examined a nationally representative sample of 21,744 Canadians, of whom 529 reported they had been diagnosed with ADHD. Data were drawn from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/kicpv2/one_in_four_women_with_adhd_has_attempted_suicide/,True,False

Right at that moment I realized that it’s true. I realized that it opens the door for you, but it’s not going to make you walk out. Think “you can lead a horse to water but you can’t make it drink” 

Specifically, the thought that made me understand the statement was work. I remembered how I was so focused and happy at work. How I finally felt accomplished and proud of the work I did. 

I was always confused why it wasn’t the same at home. I still sat in bed for 5 hours on my phone. Now I understand that the medication was working, I just wasn’t actually using it. 

Today I cleaned my room for two hours. It looks good. Still have some stuff to dust and wipe down but I’m doing that tomorrow. I did a lot of work and I’m proud of myself. 

I hope I can break my habit of sitting on my phone googling things. I hope I can start getting up and giving my all every day. And while it will be difficult, especially knowing I have CPTSD which can really make things seem impossible, I really do believe that I can change my thinking and make the most of me and my abilities. 

I wanted to share all of this for two reason. The first being that I’m proud of myself for coming to this conclusion. The ladder being for others. I want those who are in the position I was about 10 hours ago to understand and have hope. Good luck to all of you on your journey. You’ve got this! 

P.S - Now realizing all of this, it makes me actually worry about medication. Zenzedi is on back order and I’m scared of no longer having it. Hopefully I can figure it out.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/v4bufc/finally_realized_medication_is_a_tool_not_a_fix/,True,False
x0vsgt,Found a new CBT tool that is really helping me with my procrastination and avoidance of certain tasks,None,3014,2022-08-29 11:19:09,244,"I was on TikTok last week, scrolling for hours to keep getting that dopamine hit and avoiding doing a plethora of chores in the meantime. While scrolling I saw a video from a Child Psychologist talking about a gentle parenting strategy. The video explained that children are told what to do, all day every day, and therefore act out in defiance of not having their autonomy. I mean who wants to be bossed around all day, every day? 
She said one way to build up their decision making skills, independence, and self-esteem is to offer options when you need them to do something. An example she gave was needing the child to stop playing on the iPad and go brush their teeth. Instead of interrupting them and demanding them to turn off the iPad and brush their teeth right now, which most likely will turn into a tantrum, she recommends providing options where not completing the task isn’t an option. An example of that was: Hey, you need to brush your teeth before bed. Do you want to do that now, or in 10 minutes? Not brushing their teeth isn’t provided as an option. 

I thought it was a cool concept, but didn’t give it much thought since I don’t have kids, until later that day. 

This whole last week I’ve been struggling with avoiding tasks more and more and my apartment has been getting dirtier and cluttered as a result. I thought of the video, and remembered my therapist talking about reparenting ourselves to help with breaking bad habits. When the next task came up and my immediate response was that I wasn’t going to do it, I paused and gave myself the two options. “Okay, it needs to be done, so now or in 10 minutes?”

The cool thing is I immediately did the task after thinking of it this way. I didn’t wait 10 minutes, because it had to be done regardless. I tried it again several times a day for this last week, every time I avoided doing something and I’ve been more productive than I have been in years. 

I figured I would share in the hopes that this could help someone else too. 

I tried to find the video again to share a link, but couldn’t in the hundreds of my liked videos from the past week.

Update: I’m a little overwhelmed with the amount of traction this post got. I honestly had to just sign out of Reddit and let it sit for a couple days and come back to it today. I appreciate those commented saying this helped them and so glad that it did. 
For those it didn’t help, I’m sorry it didn’t work for you, but hope that you continue to try new methods to see what will.

When i watch movies at home, either on my tv or PC monitor, every atleast 15-20 minutes i just pause the movie and scroll through social media or just for some reason start watching a youtube video instead, sometimes i lose so much focus that i have to go back like 5 minutes to even figure out what was said in the movie at that point. I have a great example, last friday i watched a quiet place 1, the movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes, but i finished it in 3 hours and 25 minutes. Yeah...  


Now, CINEMA!!!! The cinema is the ONLY place i can watch a movie without losing focus or scroll through social media or just get up from my chair to do anything else than watch the movie. The reason for this is clearly because theres no way to scroll back in the movie, theres no way to pause the movie, and if you use your phone while watching a movie in the cinema, youre honestly just a little disrespectful.

Especially when it is ADHD because it hits so close to home. Nobody, not  even my parents could ever understand what is wrong with me. I was a  bright boy, but I simply could NOT focus for the life of me, and it made  me feel so bad about myself because I truly wanted more from my life.

I  remember when I asked people for advice about should I take medications  to treat my ADHD, everyone would keep telling me not to do it, how  those drugs are going to fry my brain, and I'l end up a meth addict or  crazy and how when they have trouble doing something they just breathe  or play some music or go for a walk and rest.

uwpdcg,I have inattentive type ADHD and depression. I put things off constantly. How can I stop feeling like such a failure when I wasted so much time procrastinating?,WebSearcher_,2979,2022-05-24 05:11:21,663,"

 
Five years ago, my psychiatrist diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, and ADHD. I really do not know how to differentiate between the two (not including anxiety). *I’m not as depressed anymore, just a shallow, floaty, empty feeling. Sort of like nothing.* I don’t remember what happiness feels like, so it’s quite impossible for me to miss it. I’m fine with life right now. I'm not happy, not sad. I’ve learned to be okay with that feeling.


Throughout these past years, I realized desk jobs are not for me. If the job is laid back, I never get work done. I need someone to constantly pester me to do things until I get tired of hearing them, or I probably won’t do it. Luckily, I kind of found that job. It keeps me sane, seriously.

**Main problems**

•I’m extremely forgetful and people tend to feel annoyed at me. Some of my partners/family resented me for not remembering the small things. I try to do small things for the people I care about, but stupidly forget to do so. Sometimes, in conversations I forget what we were talking about. I forget my birthday, and how old I am, frequently. I accidentally told someone I’m a year younger than what I am 😬.

•Procrastination. Sending work in late, rushing to do paperwork at the last minute. I spend so many hours procrastinating that it never gets done. I slowly watch everything pile up. 

•I endlessly scroll through social media, somehow never watching anything because I do not feel like it. I turn on the TV WANTING to watch my favorite show, but I get distracted. I’m addicted to my phone and can’t put it down unless I’m at work, there I have no choice.

•I can’t focus at all. As a teenager, I could never study because my brain just wouldn’t focus. Baseball and football were basically the only things that kept me interested in school. Now and then, I may find interest in a particular article, but I can’t get myself to even read past the title!

•I’m rarely listening to what people are saying. I usually just nod to make it look like I’m listening, although I’m really not 🤫. I just don’t feel like listening sometimes.

•I hate directions. I typically skim through and try to do it by myself (not recommended). I may find a recipe that I want to try but once I see the directions, nah, I’m good. Not only that, but I wish to read books, but I can’t get my brain to sit down and focus! And once I finally start reading, I’m probably thinking about other stuff. I have to read it like 5 times before I comprehend what I just read. Never-ending cycle.

•I make countless careless mistakes. I may write 2 instead of 1 or look for my phone while it’s in my hand. I’ve failed a test because I accidentally marked A instead of B. I literally just read “medicine” as “machine” I can’t help but laugh at myself sometimes.

•I have trouble sticking to just one thing and finishing it. I like to do all types of crafts, and I have numerous unfinished paintings/pieces sitting around. 

•Inner Monologue. That voice in my head is so annoying. I hear it right now as I type, I hear it when I read, and I hear it when I think. It never shuts up. 

I've gone through the “maybe I’m just lazy” stage. My parents grew not to expect much of me and pretty much think I’m lazy. I despised my brother because he was able to do much more than me. I grew up thinking I was inherently lazy; a failure. I honestly do not do my best work. I do just enough to get by because, chances are, I never felt like doing it anyway.

Everything is so freaking boring. I can’t stick to a hobby without losing interest. I’m really interested for a month, then I kinda find it boring and move on to something else. If I have no obligation, then I likely won’t. I WANT to do things so badly, but I feel paralyzed.

I wake up at 5am nearly every day, and I still can’t get anything done. I feel so disappointed in myself because I did absolutely nothing. I put things off constantly, that means I’m up at 5am trying to wash dishes, cleaning up, and cooking before work just because I wasted time. Hour’s go by, and I’m like *fuck*. I feel somewhat alone because I’m a dude, and most guys don’t talk about these things. I eventually end up kind of hating myself and falling to depression again. I haven’t felt proud of myself in a while.

zhyyki,Do not under any circumstances tell your job or coworkers about your diagnosis.,asthebroflys,2974,2022-12-10 10:01:17,1071,"I’ve seen some posts about bringing this topic up at work and it worries me. 

Under no circumstances should you *ever* tell your employer or  coworkers about your diagnosis, medication, or therapy. PERIOD. I’ve worked across a wide variety of industries over 20 years, from the trenches to management to Executive Leadership. I begging you, the risks are not worth it. Ever. 

*“But this one coworker of mine is a trusted friend, I’ll tell them.” * DON’T.

*“My boss is super cool, they’ll understand.” * DON’T.

I’ve seen situations where that trusted coworker you confide in tells other people with good intentions: *“I know he/she has some issues with focus/details, but they’re struggling with ADD/ADHD. They’re doing the best they can.” * But once it’s out, it’s out. 

Times get tough at work and heads are on the block. Another coworker hears about your situation, and they let it slip to management to make sure your head gets put on the block first.  Maybe times get good at work, and a promotion comes up. They’ll use your situation against you to get that job over you. 

Maybe your inattention to detail has you on the skids with your manager. You like and trust them, you want to be open and honest. You want them to know you’re trying your hardest and not being lazy.  DON’T. 

There’s a better way, tell them: “*I know I have some areas of opportunity to work on (time management / attention to detail / attendance / etc), and I have been making a major effort both personally and professionally to improve them. Here’s what I’ve improved on already. Here’s my plan to get better. Here’s my timeline to get to (X level) by (X date).”* 

I know we all want to contribute to taking away the stigma of mental illness. But putting your ass on the line is too risky. There’s other ways to champion the cause and be an advocate without sacrificing yourself. 

tl;dr CYA. Don’t tell anyone at work about your situation. Protect yourself and your career. 

Good luck out there.

Edit: This is primarily advice for those in the US. Other countries have far less toxic work environments.",0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/zhyyki/do_not_under_any_circumstances_tell_your_job_or/,True,False

1lvnt4m,My accidental medication break taught me something important…,Random-veteran-86,2963,2025-07-09 09:50:43,257,"I’ve been on Elvanse (Vyvanse) 40mg daily for about two years, and it’s genuinely transformed my ability to manage my life and work.

However, last week, I forgot my medication when going on holiday. At first, I didn’t miss it, just stepping away from work felt refreshing enough. 

After a few days though, I noticed my executive functioning take a massive hit. Simple tasks like chores, planning days, or deciding what to eat felt exhausting again.

Yet, here’s the interesting part, because I allowed my ADHD to roam free without pressure, I found genuine rest for the first time in ages. Not just physical rest, but deep, soulful rest. I listened to audiobooks, cooked, enjoyed countryside walks, and reconnected with neglected passions… basically I just let my ADHD run free and it was epic! 

It got me curious so I researched medication breaks. I found that research suggests “drug holidays” can help reset medication tolerance, reassess treatment effectiveness, and highlight areas we might neglect (Dodson, 2021; Barkley, 2020). 

But my accidental break taught me something deeper… true rest means more than sleep. For me, its meant rethinking how I approach medication and rest in my normal life.

I made a new patient appointment with a psychiatrist for today, and she told me she needs me to get psychological testing first. 

I said that’s fine. I totally get it. 

However, she ended the session by saying “I just wanted to say I find it abnormal you are applying to medical school with possible ADHD and history of depression. You need to disclose this on your applications as you are a potential harm to future patients”. She had a very angry tone. 

I kinda stared at her and said I’ll call the testing center, and then she hung up the phone. 

Mind you, I’ve never had a history of self-destructive behaviors, substance abuse, or dangerous behavior. I have been going through life normally, but just have to spend my energy trying to focus. I wanted to get some help to make my life easier.

All our lives, we've been told that we ""just to need remember/focus/do it"" in ways that imply that we're bad at things that are very easy for others. And yeah, we are, and that's okay, we are all working on it. However, this means that people with ADHD are kind of used to working all the time on things that feel very difficult or overwhelming, but are typical, normal workloads for those without our challenges. We just do. 


The problem is, this means that we learn to distrust our natural instincts that tell us when we are being overworked or asked to do more than is reasonable. We assume this is another time that ""everyone else"" is able to handle this shit, so we need to ignore burnout, anxiety and exhaustion. But it's not true!! Employers everywhere are asking their employees to do the work of 2-3 people! Or even good employers expect their worker to just give them a heads-up if they can't take on more, but their ADHD worker never will because they've been told all their life that their needs and perceptions are busted. 

So you end up with a person with ADHD who is overworked because we've been told all our life that it shouldn't be so hard and because we're convinced that we need to constantly make up for our limits by never saying no or setting boundaries.

They always seem to expect me to do things at their pace too, which I can’t do. It stresses me out. They expect me to just get up and go when I can’t motivate myself that easily. They expect me to be able to do things within a certain frame of time when giving me a time limit stresses me out.

As folks with ADHD, I feel like we are most likely to be taken advantage of. After all, we're perfect for it. We work through lunches, blissfully unaware as we plow through project after project in our hyperfocus mode. We're eager to please, and one penalty away from being let go because we miscalculated the transit time and are late yet again. Were scolded for offending our in-office coworkers, but denied the ability to work from home despite being their best worker.

And for some reason, we are torn up at the possibility of inconveniencing everyone at work when we have to take time off, or make a hard decision of moving up in our career. When I tearfully explained to my mother of the inner turmoil I was suffering at a crossroad where I needed to leave my job for a short period of time, she sagely told me this: ""You owe your employer nothing. They expect people to come and go as the need arises. If you've decided this is the best decision for you, leave your job and don't look back.""

Don't feel bad about moving on in your life. Whether it's to stay at home with your children, or to move to a different company with better pay. Don't burn bridges. But a good employer will harbor no bad feelings if you leave on good terms. Put yourself first, and as one of my employers told me to my face ""take your damn lunch break already"".

qlb8yt,"What ""ADHD-hacks"" have you tried that actually worked?",ewiwaa,2905,2021-11-02 11:51:02,1284,"I'm always curious as to what tricks, life hacks, and methods seems to actually help people with adhd manage their symptoms. 

Many tips given to me by professionals were never any helpful because they all relied on the idea that I just had to work harder, which of course made me quit maybe one or two tries in. For example, reminders on the phone? Only makes me annoyed. Mindfulness meditation? Makes me so frustratingly bored that I want to fight.

However, some tips given to me by actual ADHD-ers have worked much better. 

For example, I got the tip to hang my pants on shower curtain rings in my closet as opposed to putting them in a drawer because I just forget I own them, and I've kept at it for years and it still works! Much less work than pant-hangers but fills the same purpose.

Another thing is the ""task bracelet system"" where for each task I make a bracelet and put that around my wrist. Once the task is finished I put the bracelet in a big bowl. It gives me a sense of accomplishment, and the bracelet helps me to remember to do the thing and helps me get back on track if I get distracted. At the end of the day I'll have a bowl full of bracelets and it gives me another accomplishment-boost seeing how much I did today.

What ADHD-hacks have you tried that actually worked for you? Are there any that surprised you?

**EDIT:** A few have asked about the bracelets and I answered in the comments but I'll repeat myself here!

Basically they can be made literally however you want, but the most common way I've seen people do it is that they buy a bunch of spiral hair ties/bracelets and key tags and write a reoccurring task on it. 

Whenever you need to get that task done you put it on, and don't take it off until it's done. You'll probably have multiple bracelets on at the start of the day, which is gonna annoy the hell out of you and you'll be more motivated to get shit done! 

Not to mention that when you take off the bracelet and put it in the ""finished"" jar (or box, or bowl- whichever floats your goat) you get a dopamine hit! And seeing the jar full of finished tasks at the end if the day makes you feel really accomplished too.

I actually found this tip on TikTok, so to get more info you should head over there and look through the taskbracelet hashtag!

n6rj6n,I think I found a way to explain neurotypical people who’s like with adhd,Rudeness_Queen,2899,2021-05-06 22:50:03,417,"The other day my therapist told me to come with an analogy to explain my adhd to neurotypical people, and this what I came up with:

Imagine you have a laptop, like everyone else. 

Yes, everyone’s laptops tend to freeze once in a while, or it runs slower when you have too much stuff going on, consuminabout 6 of your 8 GB of ram. Or start overheating a little if  you use it like + 12 hours straight. And if you get a major complication, you can just change the parts, expand the RAm or memory, or even get a new one. 

But this laptop has like 2 GB of RAM, tends to overheat all the time, has 50 tabs in simultaneous with you CAN’T close, no matter how many times you try, and it takes like 50 tries before it lets you save the word document you were writing. It even erases some of your documents without warning, and there’s almost no way of getting them back. It freezes all the time and, if you force it too much, it will overheat and turn off. You need to let it cool of before you can use it back. 

Even worse, there’s a 3 year old kid you have to share it with. There’s just that stupid laptop for the two of you. That kid doesn’t care if you’re working in something important, it will make a tantrum and try to take it from you because they can. And whenever they try to use the computer, they want to use it to play games, or watch something on YouTube, or something unrelated to whatever you’re doing. And when the computer freezes or runs off, they will make a big tantrum and you can’t calm them down.  

Most people would say “but why don’t you get a new laptop?” And the answer is: you can’t. That laptop you got came with lots of factory defects, and they won’t let you change it. You just have to learn to work with it. YOU are the one who has to work around the laptop, not the other way. AND you gotta deal with that stupid kid, because you have to share it with them. It is YOU who has to learn how to deal with them, since they won’t listen to you.

When I get to take my meds, it’s like I get to put the computer in a stand  that has a refrigeration system. It won’t overheat as fast, and it starts to run more smoothly. It will finally let you close those unnecessary tabs, it won’t freeze instantly, and you can almost save your files without having to try it 59 times. Just one or two times is enough. Your data won’t be erased without warning. And it won’t reset every five minutes. You can almost use it like a normal laptop, and get your work done.

It also gives that stupid 3 years old kid a candy, so he won’t bother you for a while. You can finally use it for yourself, and give all your attention to your tasks. 

The only thing is that please please please please PLEASE don’t bother the kid. He’s calm right now, so don’t agitate him. It’s super difficult to get him to listen to you at least ONCE. Just let me enjoy those hours of calmness.

I'm really jealous of people who can just go do things.,BerrySundae,2892,2021-02-18 10:46:30,112,"I made tacos, and realized we had no cheese. My husband would normally go, but he wanted to work so I was going instead. I asked my school-age sister (I'm her guardian) to come with me to the store, cause she's barely left her bed this week since it's Feb break for her. She whined about leaving her game with her friends until I realized the irritation wasn't worth it for me in that moment.

I asked my husband to have a conversation with her after I left about how she needs to not prioritize playing games over household duties. I'm a gamer too, I get you can't pause everything, but I offered to wait 15 minutes. She's just running around with her friends on Roblox, she'll do that until bedtime after we get back anyway. He, well-intentioned, immediately went to tell her to come see him after she got a break in her game.

I went in and out of brain fog for a while trying to figure out what was missing in the fridge, since we hasn't cooked in a couple of days and there were no leftovers so it looked like there was a huge amount of empty space. Then I talked to my husband about what he was going to say to my sister, since I wanted him to be clear that her playing games with her friends for most of the day is not a problem, she just needs to be able to drop it when needed. She likely also has ADHD. I don't want to shame her for literally what I do sometimes (play video games all day), I just want to teach her a life skill.

Of course, after this conversation finishes time magically passes (I have no idea what happened) and suddenly it's been 25 minutes and my sister comes out of her room. She thinks she's coming with me. I say oh, that wasn't the plan, but yeah grab your coat. She, confused and frustrated, is like wait, is that not why I was being called out? I was going to spare her the lecture since she came out on her own, so I had already told her that wasn't what it was about. She, realizing that she was not being forced to leave, slowly inched back to her room. She says something along the lines of ""oh, I don't want to make you upset though, so call me out to get groceries!"" And I'm like... no. I'm asking you to come with me. I have 3 times. You already left your game, and still refuse. I'd rather forget you're there than accept half help.

She goes and plays her game, I, frustrated, look around the kitchen more and realize its been 45 minutes. I had decided that rather than just go get cheese for dinner, I needed to take my sister and get all the groceries. I go ""well, okay, fuck this, no one wants dinner anyway"" and angrily flop on my bed. I bash my head a few times (bad I know), kick around, and eventually just start crying. My husband comes to see whats up, and I'm like...

@husband: I know I unfairly load you with a lot of daily tasks. Laundry. Groceries. Dishes. Lots of stuff. But it's because I ask you to do something and you just **do** it. And you're done in half an hour or less. I could have been back from the store 20 minutes ago. It's so unfair that every time I try to do something simple, I end up trying to do 5 other things. And it's not even distractions in this case. Even now I think it makes more sense to go get all the groceries. I think my sister needs to get out of the house. I think correcting her being so tunnel-visioned without being yanked out of it and pouting the whole time is important. I still, while sitting here breaking down, can't just prioritize getting the fucking cheese. I'm realizing I needed someone to go with me just so I had a bit more accountability and I didn't get distracted in the kitchen or zone out driving or grab 10 unrelated things in the store. And I was just angry about it. While I was crying I was angry it happened, angry I was wasting time crying over it, angry that I was hungry, angry that I was distracting my husband from work. Just angry.

It sucks because I feel like I can just go do it. My leg isn't broken, I'm not dizzy, I wasn't anxious prior to breaking down, it doesn't *feel* like there's anything preventing me from leaving. It's just repeated choices I'm making. And yet it happens over and over and over again even as I chastise myself for it.

I took a solid hour to properly calm down (it was like a release valve got hit, I would calm down for a minute then get angry and cry again). After that all 3 of us went to the store. Dinner was cold. I still grabbed random things (I HAVE FRESH MOZZARELLA FOR HOMEMADE PIZZAAAA!) But I felt better. I'm lucky I have support. But god ADHD sucks.

I'm trying to be nicer to myself. I'm not angry I've not gotten a lot of things done this week that I meant to. I just felt so powerless.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/lmty4d/i_broke_down_crying_yesterday_because_i_realized/,True,False
bq3ywt,"This is how people with ADHD can work twice as long, work 3x faster, complete more than 5x the amount of tasks, see over 1000% more detail...and still feel like crap for not getting anything done.",navajosh,2892,2019-05-18 06:24:53,296,"Here’s an example I use to explain to others what happens when I’m tasked with something. Over the years “task” has meant: homework, housework, work assignments, group tasks, personal hobbies, fill in the blank...  

##Situation #1:

*Say you ask someone (neurotypical) to do “Task A”, you need it done in 3 hours.*

They look at it and see about 10 steps needed complete it. They work for 2 hours and get 9 of those 10 done. “Good enough”, they think. In their mind, they’re ending with a mental todo list 90% finished. They go relax for an hour.

If they got a grade? A-. They walk away feeling good having finished a task and doing it pretty well.

###*So: 9 out of 10 tasks in 2 hours. That’s roughly one task every 15 mins to get 90% done and an hour to relax. Internal score: A-*


##Now, Situation #2:

*You ask me (ADHD, 2e) to do “Task A”:*

I look and see 100 possible details. I catch a vision of what “Task A” could be, and am extremely excited by it. I see how “Task A” fits into other Tasks (B, C, D, E, F), and how it makes them easier for other people. “Task A” if done right, can support itself, help the people who need to do it after me and potentially generate enough resources to create new Tasks (W!?, X!?, Y!?...dare I say, even Z!?) Man, if I can get this done “Task A” will be incredible. This feeling...it’s electric. 

At first glance I can see at least 9 details related to, and needing accounted for, each of the original 10 steps. I’m unfamiliar with a couple of the details, so I’ll need to do some research to resolve my questions. What’s more, there are irrelevant details buried in the pile, but I don’t know which ones yet, so I’ll need to be actively sifting those out while I work.

For the next 4 hours I work on it like crazy, riding the wave of my excitement. Guided by the image in my head, I’m working hard to get it done. But, because of distractibility, I get sidetracked other random tasks.  Add to that I’ve come up with 10-20 more unforeseen and potentially irrelevant details. It’s okay though, I’m getting momentum and really starting to weave the threads together. 

My focus is having holes poked in it because people keep interrupting me. It’s not malicious, they are just being friendly by saying “Hi”, or trying to get me to smile because I look so intense. They don’t know how hard I’m holding my focus together, and that every distraction is like a wind gust against my attentional house of cards. There’s been some unravelling, but I try to shake off my anger and get back to reweaving them quickly. 

I‘ve been working at a pace of about one task every 5 mins. I look up and realize its been 4 hours, “crap!” I’m an hour over. I take stock of where I’m at. I have crossed 48 tasks off my mental todo list of (now) 120, but am only about 40% finished. That’s a big mental “F” (in more ways than one).

###*So: 48 of 120 tasks in 4 hours. One task every 5 minutes and only 40% done. Score: F*

**This is how people with ADHD can work twice as long, work 3x faster, complete more than 5x the amount of tasks, see over 1000% more detail...and still feel like crap for not getting anything done.**

Okay...I try to take stock of where I am. At the pace I was going, it will take me 10 hours to finish. The break has made me realize I haven’t eaten. I’m starting to feel bad. I’m mentally exhausted and my brain is fried. I’m way over my deadline and it was needed an hour ago. At this stage its not even finished enough to be usable. 

This isn’t the first time this has happened, far from it, so now I’m also feeling defeated. I also feel demotivated because I don’t actually know how much longer its going to take me to finish, so I engage in procrastination as a stress relief tool. 

Now I’m working much slower, because experiencing this pattern is what kickstarts a depression. “This always happens...” I look at what I still need to do. It’s likely going to take me a possible 50+ hours to work through the remaining 72 tasks I FEEL need to get done. The end of the task stretches away toward the horizon, like a long, vast road. *”Man, this sucks...”*. Every minute I continue is a slog that drags me down further. But it has to get done...

I stay up all night working on it. The silence and lack of interruption helps, but it’s still slow.

...In the morning come the text messages.  People asking me questions about the task. Some innocuous, *“Hey, just checking on the status of “Task A”?”*, some not, *“Hey we NEED “Task A” to be done as soon as possible, we have people waiting on it. When will you be done?”* I feel shame.

An immediate dread that feels like daggers. Stress. Cortisol and adrenaline coursing through my body like a weird familiar fire. And then, an immediate dive into a full depression. 

I feel they are justified in their frustration. I’m frustrated with me too. 

*“Why does this always happen?”*    
*“Why can’t I just get things done?”*    
*“Why is this so hard for me when it’s so easy for other people?”*    
*“Why can’t I just think more simply?”*    

And then to add to the heartbreak, *“Man, this could be so useful, and so great...if I could just get it done.”*

“...”

*“...I suck.”*    
*“...I hate this feeling.”*    
*“...I wish I wasn’t such a failure.”*    


It’s a strange thing we have. It’s the source of my creativity and wonder. And also the source of my darkest times. That feeling fades, and some things get better. But this pattern seems to be close at all times.

I feel like I’m always trying to defend why “creative” people seem to struggle getting things done. While it’s exacerbated by ADHD, it is also a problem with creative types. While they are commonly judged as flaky or undisciplined, I really think it has to do with the challenge of having more dots to connect than the average person. And then having to deal with the mental repetitive stress injuries that come from weathering other’s lack of understanding. Which then only reflexes back onto the problem like a serpent that is eating its own tail.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/bq3ywt/this_is_how_people_with_adhd_can_work_twice_as/,True,False

They gave me a good offer more than I was expecting. I'm pretty qualified in my field (oil and gas) so I took it, moved my entire life and all my belongings over 1000 miles to the middle of nowhere in Utah.

The job was okay but super corporate and there was little direction from upper management. Not good for me. Made a small mistake and I was fired :( I had zero performance issues before this. It stung pretty badly.

Not to mention my mom died suddenly after the move. So I wasn't in the best mental state which exacerbated my ADHD symptoms and absolutely demolished my executive functioning and ability to focus. I was also largely unmedicated because I was waiting for my insurance to kick in so I could finally get back on my medication full time.

I wasn't even given a chance.... despite my 10+ years of experience.....

Worst part is they provided me with employee housing which they booted me out of rendering me homeless. :( And when I tell you there is NO housing out here, NONE.... I'm talking extremely lucky to find a 2 bedroom for $3500-4000. I don't know anyone, no friends or family. No girlfriend or wife.

I am keeping my chin up but it's hard not to feel like a fucking loser. Like a joke. I take a chance to better my life and immediately fuck it up. I don't know why I even try. Nothing I do is good enough for other people. I just look stupid, lazy and careless to them.

My wife and I had our firstborn 3 months ago and we have some of her eggs frozen on a fertility clinic.

Those eggs are the last shot we have to have more children.

I think I missed the deadline for the yearly payment to keep the eggs frozen.

I missed the goddamn deadline, I'm sure of it.

Tomorrow Ill call the center, they're close now. The anxiety I'm feeling now is brutal.

I fucked up, big. I fucking suck, fuck ADHD, fuck me for not having better coping mechanism and fuck the fertility center for not calling us before the deadline.

Update: thank you all for your support and your thoughts, you helped me sleep through the night.

I've called this morning and they told me the eggs are fine and that the deadline they told me was just ""august"". So I guess my anxiety made me freak out and remember a deadline that never existed.

I'm on speaking terms with my wife now, I gave her a little kiss in the lips and my head is still attached to my body, I think everything will be fine.",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/pa6vnn/i_may_have_fucked_up_really_really_bad/,True,True

I was so excited that I remembered to have breakfast (let alone make it) I left my gas stove on. I got it before I burned the damn house down but I’m shaking. Ugh I hate myself some days.

Okay rant over. 

EDIT - you guys, thank you so much for the love and support! My day started off shitty yesterday, but reading through your comments made me laugh and feel better. It means the world to me. And I'm sure to anyone else that has had this happen. Got a little choked up reading some of the comments. One of the best ones is (summarizing) ""I did something stupid doesn't mean I am stupid"". Sometimes it's nice to have a reminder. 

PS my husband didn't notice a smell, but I ended up telling him because I felt so bad. He said 'We have an fire extinguisher in the kitchen for that reason, no big deal, nothing happened'.

It damn well isn't. These are all issues of boundaries. Not of ADHD. Sometimes we mess up and hurt people. But it's not the same as going out of our way to pick behavior that makes us hurt people. 

I was subbed to the ADHD partner sub for a few months and unfollowed it because half of the topics are about jerks being jerks and their partner trying to explain it with ADHD.

You’ve let me go because “it’s been twice where I haven’t shown up to work and you had to call around looking for me”. 

I got nurses/paramedics to call you an hour PLUS before my shift started. Both times. You didn’t pick up until an hour after my shift would’ve started. BOTH TIMES. 

But you know this.

Both of these times, as explained in both discharge letters, were UNEXPECTED. I could not have foreseen almost having a heart attack the day before it happened, these meds are designed to help me. 

Again, you literally know this. 

You know my dad hits me, you know I now don’t have a home because I couldn’t live around him anymore. You know I had to fight to get a government payment. 

You know that payment depends on how many hours I work. I need a certain amount of hours a week to get the payment and you know that. 

You let me cry on your shoulder the day after I left my dad. You said you’d support me. You fired me over text and won’t pick up my calls. You didn’t tell any of my coworkers or the kids that I take care of. You didn’t even let me say goodbye to the fucking kids. 


All in all, you suck. 


Un-kind regards,

- I am 19 and have zero dollahs for a lawyer/legal options

yoqk8d,"If hyperactive ADHD is a car with no brakes, inattentive ADHD has them slammed on full",Citysurvivor,2855,2022-11-07 07:36:32,389,"If hyperactivity is a case of not enough ""brakes"", not enough ability to resist distractions, impulses, etc., then isn't inattentiveness the opposite, a case of halting at everything?

Like, you may feel ten different desires and impulses to act on, but instead of hitting the gas and racing after them, you sit there paralysed and thinking about them all, stalled.

""Emotional dysregulation"" doesn't really apply, because the brakes kick in and strong emotions fizzle out before they can be acted upon. Which is a small blessing that holds back stupid impulses, I guess...

It feels like the inattentive brain just ""hits the brakes"" on everything. Maybe it's a case of a once-hyperactive mind trying to stop itself from speeding away and crashing into everything?

n4vtl3,I got into Law School!,DeepThought80,2860,2021-05-04 12:26:11,149,"I was diagnosed at the ripe age of 39 after my daughter was diagnosed.  I can say that treatment has literally changed my life.

So now, at the age of 41 I have been accepted into a part time law school program and I think I might actually be able to achieve the dream that I set out to do in my 20's.

I am beyond grateful.

&#x200B;

**ETA:** Oh my goodness!  Thank you all for such kind words!  And also thank you for all the awards!

Some folks have asked what treatment I am receiving so the short answer is I'm on meds.  Specifically Adderall XR.  I've been on the same dosage for a year now and it works well for me.  

The long answer is I was undiagnosed for soooo long that I had developed a lot of coping strategies.  39 years of trial and error.  I went back to school when our family lost our business in 2014 for a post baccalaureate paralegal certification class.  I graduated from that program with a 4.0 and there were some things that really helped when I was unmedicated.    

1. I would always sit up front.  I just could get too easily distracted in the back.  I'm not trying to be a gunner my first year but I know I'll be sitting up front because daggummit I will get distracted by the fact that the person in front of me has their shirt tag sticking out.  

2. White noise or rain sounds in my noise cancelling headphones when I had to study or was in the middle writing a brief or memo.  I could really get in the zone with that.  

3. Someone mentioned not using a laptop because it's too easy to get distracted and I have to say I agree.  I looooove my Rocket notebook and so I'll probably continue to use that when I get into law school.  I was intrigued about using a iPad with the writing stylus but I think I'll just stick to my Rocket Notebook.  It's reusable and I can scan with my phone to upload into my OneDrive Account with specific folders for classes.  

I will probably will need to start seeing my therapist again on a regular basis so I can keep some perspective during this whole thing.  I know it's going to be a long slog but I know I can do it.  My Mom went back to become and ARNP in her late 30's, early 40's and she's still practicing and loving it and she had 4 kids!  I only have two and my in-laws live with us so I have lots of help with the day to day stuff for the kiddos.  Not to mention my husband is an absolute domestic rock-star (once I graduate, he'll most likely go down to P/T at his job so he can be at home more with the kids and his parents which is A-OK by me!)  

Once again, thank you all so much!  Your encouragement means a lot and just know that I'm rooting for all of you as well who are doing ""hard things"" even with this wonky diagnosis.  You all rock!  ",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/n4vtl3/i_got_into_law_school/,True,False

They are able to execute the instructions I've given them properly and benefit from it, but when it comes to executing plans I've made for myself I just never seem to get it right or rather I shouId say that I never seem to get started. 

Edit : Thank you kind strangers for the gold & silver.
I've noticed that some people are saying that they are not good planners and that they execute best at the last minute. I find that relatable, even though I think of myself as a good planner. The most productive and noteworthy things I've been able to accomplish were all unplanned and kinda pushed on me. I think all ADHD people live by the motto, ""If tomorrow isn't the due date, today isn't the do date"". 
Reading comments from you all makes me think that I am reading about myself just on different days of the week. I can literally relate to everything you all are saying. This kinda makes me feel that we are all in this together and we will get through it all.

My mum really doesn't understand that I can't just switch my 'cleaning bug' on and off. Once I've hyperfixated on cleaning, that's all I want to do until it's done. If I have to stop to do something else, it'll likely be days until I can return to it. 

The worst was yesterday, I went to take down the Christmas tree (a really tedious task given how many ornaments are hung on it) because I was in the mood for it. She said I shouldn't take it down so soon because SHE was enjoying it (this is the same person that wouldn't let me put it up until December because it was ""too early"").

I told her that I was in the mood to do it and if I left it until later it would become a really tedious chore that she'd have to pester me into doing. She just couldn't understand. I even asked that she help me take it down when I'm inevitably not in the mood for it since she's the one that I'm leaving it up for. She just said ""hopefully if I have the energy"" which only annoyed me more because I know I won't ""have the energy"" but will have to do it anyway.

Most people have a standard 35mm camera lens for information. They can zoom in and hold focus there, but can't see whats immediately around that focus/aren't distracted by it.

ADHD is like a fish eye lense. I see the bigger picture, but also struggle to zoom in and maintain focus with all the surrounding noise.

The result is better pattern recognition, creativity and big picture thinking, empathy, etc. But I can't stay zoomed in on things, which can be a weakness in certain work roles and environments.

Whats worked for you, explaining to friends or partners etc?

I want to hear about the activities you find yourself engrossed in when no one else is watching. The kind of thing you'd be embarassed to admit how much time you spend doing.


For example, I love exploring random areas on google maps, reading reviews of the various stores/restaurants and categorizing them into lists to be filed away. Sometimes I go to the places I save, but mostly I just plan out imaginary day trips i never end up going on. I can easily spend hours doing this. I'll admit it sounds kind of harmless, but some nights i will open google maps to figure out where I want to go for dinner, only to hear my stomach grumbling, realize 3 hours have passed, and all of the restaurants I've saved are now closed.


And on a more mundane note, I also consume copius amounts of youtube 🙂

All my life, I’ve felt like there was something different about me. I used to throw tantrums as a kid. I got distracted easily, couldn’t focus, and I’d get overwhelmed whenever I was around big crowds. I didn’t know what it was, but I always felt off.

Instead, I grew up thinking I was just lazy or moody or needed to try harder. I felt like I was being gaslighted by everyone around me. Like I was the problem, and I just couldn’t get my act together. I felt wronged, but endured time and time again. 

I only found out I have ADHD now that I’m in my twenties. That’s when my parents finally told me. They said they kept quiet so I could live a “normal” life. They said they just silently endured everything, hoping I’d be okay.

But I did not. If living a normal life meant being judged every single day, then for me, I did not live a normal life at all. 

The moment I heard the truth from them, that’s when everything started making sense. The tantrums were signs. The overstimulation from large crowds was sensory overload. The restlessness, humming, fidgeting wasn’t because I was being naughty, it's just me stimming.  And the way I played the same songs on loop or obsessed over random stuff? They were hyperfixations. I wasn’t just being difficult. I was trying to survive the way I knew how.

I felt betrayed. If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have spent so much time masking. I wouldn’t have kept pretending I was fine. I would’ve had the words to explain myself. Maybe people wouldn’t have judged me so much. Maybe I wouldn’t have judged myself.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1m4mt2n/my_parents_kept_my_adhd_diagnosis_for_20_years_so/,False,False

I know it's a recognised neurological disorder in the DSM and all, that it impacts executive functioning, emotional regulation and impulse control. I know my brain isn't neurotypical and that my struggles are real.

But at the end of the day, the person who constantly tells me my ADHD is bullshit isn't a family member or friend - it's me.

""You don't even have ADHD, stop making excuses. Stop being so goddamn lazy and just do it. Who do you think you are? Why are you so special you need drugs to help you? Just work harder. You're so undisciplined, it's embarrassing for someone your age. Everyone else can do it. Get your shit together and stop this ""it's my ADHD"" victim nonsense.""

""What is wrong with you?""

This leads to risky and obsessive behaviors like impulse buying or, for me, abusing alcohol. I abused alcohol religiously, and it took many years of my young adult life. It wasn't until I started taking ADHD seriously that my life started to turn around. 

I've had to learn how to be bored again and know that it's alright. Contentment is oh so powerful, and I try to practice that as well.

Last week he finally admitted that the reason he was so inconsistent was because he had been struggling with the prospect of having children with ADHD given the degree of heritability. He is doctor who has worked in paediatric psychiatry and he has seen what severe childhood ADHD looks like. 

He now claims he is going to therapy to see whether this is something he can get resolve because he likes me and has no issue with my adhd but can’t accept his children potentially “going off the rails”. 

I’ve been obsessing about the situation because I genuinely like him and I am really hurt.

I can never ""win"" arguments with my wife, or even make her acknowledge the merits of what I'm saying because when she says ""when have I ever..."" I can't remember anything. Ever. Even though I know she's said or done it, probably recently. 

Its just really fucking frustrating. 

/rant

**Edit: Thanks for all the replies! It's really nice to know that I'm not the only one!**

A few addenda: 
First, no, my wife isn't gaslighting me. This isn't something she does maliciously. As I replied to one redditor: my frustration comes less from my wife asking ""when..."" because in a healthy, and compassionate relationship that's a fair question. It's more from my inability to articulate the ""when"".

That being said, if you're in a relationship where you believe someone is doing this to you on purpose, that's absolutely not healthy. 

Second, yeah, I know no one ""wins"" an argument, that's why I put it in quotes. I don't run around picking fights with my wife so that I can tally some imaginary scoreboard. Nor does she with me. 

Third, I got some really great responses, and I appreciate all the constructive feedback! Yall are awesome. I tried to compile all the various suggestions I got, so here they are: 

**Retaining Details:**

/u/msmurasaki
You have to get a calendar and then jot down stuff on those days you don't like a certain aspect. Then review them occasionally to help you remember. Also find the source of the problem, not the instance. Use that calendar to find the actual source/pattern that you don't like. E.g. if she says something rude now and then, don't bring up ONE instance. Rather go to the source, which may be 'i find that sometimes you say inconsiderate things, I hope that you can take a Second to think next time before saying stuff that may hurt, and rather be more tactful. If she asks for examples, THEN you bring up the instances in that calendar.

A lot of people suggested keeping some form of notes: journal, phone notes, Gnotes, diary, text screenshots, etc. And just as many people said they feel a little petty or creepy about it to which /u/gonnaquittom said: “If you want to feel less pretty about it you could call it journaling, which it is.”

Several people also suggested discussing the issue immediately if you can.

On the flip side: /u/jcon877 observed that sometimes we need time to gather all the info given to us, piece it all together and form our response. “For me, this can take 1 hour or even a whole day sometimes.”

**Meta-Discussion:** 
 
/u/Slingshotsters brought up the idea of the “metafight.” I really liked the idea, so I’m stealing it. Lots of advice came down to how to have a better conversation with my wife, up to and including having the “meta-fight” discussion, i.e. talking about how we talk about things.

/u/lizzledizzles pointed out that we shouldn’t allow the argument to get bogged down in semantics, which is basically exactly what happens when we start chasing the “when have I ever…” line of reasoning. And /u/WhyAreYouAllHere added to that by pointing out we shouldn’t allow “kitchen sinking,” we should try to understand what we want to talk about and stick as closely to that as possible. If/when that’s not possible, maybe try the argument mapping suggestions. Or, as /u/huckfinn52 said “I stopped trying to remember instances and details and I just focus on remembering my feelings.” 

When it comes to talking to our S/O’s more effectively, /u/Yellow_Lemon_Monster suggested providing context. Sometimes they don’t need to know exactly what happened. As /u/crazydevillady pointed out “Even if I don’t remember specifics - I blurt out jumbled pieces. Then for a brief second, I can see it register in his eyes- even when I can’t piece it together.”

For those of us who just aren’t great at talking anyway, /u/sebtaylor01suggested we “don’t talk about it, put it in writing.” I actually have used this method with my wife in the past. We’ll put stuff in an email to initiate a conversation. That allows us to organize our thoughts, and re-read everything, and make sure we’re saying what we want to say. /u/Orangegrapejello pointed out that text and email is also be useful for relationships that aren’t on great terms (ex’s, estranged family, etc)

/u/reluctantlyvegan said we should learn to “accept the stalemate.” Sometimes the best we can do is to make our point as best as we can and hope that our S/O will understand us after they’ve had some time to process.

**Argument Mapping:**

/u/OliviaParamour
“when I get into a serious argument/discussion, what I try to do is:
Take a piece of paper and draw a line. a timeline from the start of the argument to the end of the argument (i assume 1 hour)
And then I draw lines coming out of that lines when points are made by either of us.
If we go down a branch of an argument, then I draw a line of that line and continue it.”

**Active Listening:**

If our S/O’s initiate the conversation (or even if they didn’t) /u/elciteeve noted that “it's important to actively listen... Make sure you understand them and validate their feelings (which doesn't mean just Agreeing with their point.) I think especially for adhd people it's easy to instantly go into full rejection mode and either shut down, get defensive, or whatever other non-helpful strategy we learn as kids.

Remember that by actively listening and asking for clarification, then validating their feelings, you might realise you interpreted their meaning wrong at first. Which is how many arguments turn heated so quickly.”

/u/NettingStick suggested “radical honesty. If anything’s bugging us, we bring it up immediately and neither of us treats it as some sort of personal attack or failing.” This isn’t for the faint of heart, though. 

**Side note:**

Finally, /u/jonnierod offered some valuable insight into the reliability of working memory generally: “I used to do investigations at work and one thing I learned is that when you hold anybody's memory up to the harsh light of evidence no one has a good memory. No one. I never interviewed a person who didn't at one point or another have to amend their statement as more evidence was presented. I'm not saying they were lying, I'm just saying when people start having to verify what they know we all fold like lawn chairs.”

Thanks again everyone!

nh1li3,To the students who mock our professor with ADHD,None,2794,2021-05-20 07:24:50,220,"Thank you, I’m quite decided against teaching because I certainly don’t want to deal with such mean, unempathetic students like you. 

Yes, I know you don’t know he has ADHD (he mentioned it to me when he saw my accommodations), but that shouldn’t stop you from treating him as a human. 

Do you really have to make such a huge fuss that he didn’t answer your email? Can’t you just send a follow up or attend office hours? Do you need to equate lateness with low intelligence?

Yes, he’s not the best teacher, but have you noticed he goes out of the way to explain when you ask questions? Why don’t you, for once, unmute yourself and ask him questions about what you’re confused about rather than bi**hing that get meaner and meaner every passing day? 

Do you really have to make personal attacks and escalate all minor failures into one big ball?

You bunch are just not cool.

EDIT: 

Since this is coming up in comments: I’m not saying professors should be excused for bad teaching because they have ADHD. I’m essentially saying:

1. Professors are humans too. It doesn’t hurt to cut a little slack for a late email, and follow up. I request (always granted) deadline extensions; why can’t I give my professor some grace by not expecting an immediate reply? Or there’s always office hours if he’s specially unresponsive. 

2. There’s a difference between constructive criticism vs borderline bullying. Frustrated with a teacher? Well and fair, I myself write wordy evals. Using him as the butt of jokes? Nope. Making out everything he does as a mistake? Nope.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/nh1li3/to_the_students_who_mock_our_professor_with_adhd/,True,False

When hearing about adderall from everyone else, it’s easy to put it on a pedestal, and become easily reliant and attached to the medication as if it’s going to turn you into a superhero. Sad news is, it doesn’t. While it certainly helps(!), it’s not a miracle drug. It doesn’t write your schedule, it doesn’t go to the grocery store for you, and it definitely doesn’t do your laundry (sadly). It’s very easy to take it, and waste the whole day doing “more important tasks” like grinding Valorant and Overwatch. You’re still you, and you still have ADHD. The other half of the equation to treatment is discipline and practice. I’ve been expecting that after taking adderall, that I would magically just become Mr. Business Man and start planning everything weeks ahead, be able to get all my chores done, and etc., you get the point. I guess what I’m trying to say, is that adderall isn’t the end all be all. And to rely on a medication to do that for you is a recipe for substance abuse. Adderall helps, it really does.

13fnaht,Have you heard of the speech disorder: “CLUTTERING”? OMG mind blown!!,sockandles,2787,2023-05-12 07:49:40,331,"My mind has been blown.

I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/13camch/how_do_you_control_your_excessive_impulsive_fast/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) on here a few days ago that got a lot of traction. I talked about how I struggle with fast speech, compulsive talking, rambling, etc. Many of you related to this. 

Amongst the 100+ comments, there was [one person](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/13camch/how_do_you_control_your_excessive_impulsive_fast/jjgdzx8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3) who mentioned that I look up “Cluttering” speech disorder. Oh. My. God.  Thank god I read that comment. This is me!!! 

I have never heard of “Cluttering” before — I always just thought the fast, random way I talk was “just how I talk.” NOPE. IT’S ACTUALLY A CLASSIFIED SPEECH DISORDER!

I’ve been hyper focused on learning all I can about [Cluttering Speech Disorder](https://www.stutteringhelp.org/cluttering) last night.. and I imagine I will keep going for next few days. 
But so far I’ve learned that in my case, cluttering presents as:

• rapid speech. Speed can get very fast especially when excited about topic. Can feel like a run on sentence with no pause till the end

• a lot of “editing sentence” or revising speech out loud in real time. 

• Interrupting myself (with new train of thought or revisions)

• “mazing” or topic shifting very rapidly in conversations which results in tangents

• a lot of filler words: “like” “um ya” “maybe”


Essentially it feels like I have 10 things to say and want to say them all at once so they burst out and can come out incoherent or in a seemingly disorganized way. It often feels like I’m chasing my thoughts with my words and am not mindful about what I say — words are just kinda spilling out as I think out loud and my speech can’t keep up. Ive heard a lot of “so where are you going with this?” Or “what’s the point of this” “you lost me” or kinda deep breaths after I finish talking like “whoa” or people don’t know how to or where to start in responding Cus I just said a whole lot.


Cluttering speech disorder is also closely related to ADHD. I believe it has a lot to do with planning, impulsivity, regulation, hyper activity. 

I am not an expert of course. I’ve only learned about this now.. and wow. Mind blown. Can’t wait to employ some strategies to help with this. Sharing Cus maybe it’ll blow your mind too.

•••

Update: I am so so thrilled this thread has blown up, and so many people have had epiphanies like me in the comments! It was truly eye opening when I had a name for this disorder, and reading all these comments I feel not alone in this!!!

I’ve found this [Predictive Cluttering Inventory](https://everythingslp.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/predictive-cluttering-index-pci.pdf) online which breaks down some of the patterns/symptoms that might be present with this disorder. Of course, please consult a professional (not me, a random on the internet who just learned of this yesterday).

I’m excited for where I go from here, although I will probably become hyper-aware of myself doing this for a while — which may be good or bad. But self awareness is critical for me, so I’m so happy I’ve been able to find this and share it with all of you!!!

I moved across the country, started my own business while finishing my degree virtually but suddenly I cannot seem to keep the pace on balancing everything with schoolwork and also getting work to people on time/growing my brand etc. I keep choosing the wrong thing to spend my time on, like things that literally dont matter or affect my future, finances, or professional image which are all things I truly WANT to be focused on. 

 I truly feel like I am overwhelmed by the thought of how to begin something important that I just never do OR get so fixated on finding the best way to organize everything on paper so it makes the best/most productive sense that I spend more time figuring that out than I do actually doing the tasks and then *POOF!* my day is over.

hhnssf,ADHD has turned me into a jack of all trades but master at absolutely none,Avievent,2792,2020-06-28 15:23:58,235,"I can’t not be doing something, with my hands even if I’m just chilling out I’m fiddling with something which means I tend to pick up crafts and hobbies all the time. Yet I never stick with them long enough at a time to become really, really good at them. 

Sewing, quilting, crochet, drawing, painting, model-making, woodworking, knitting, printed cross-stitch, coloring, writing, reading, growing house plants, cooking, baking, training my dog, landscaping, gardening, random diy stuff, Magic the Gathering, gaming, etc. I have probably somewhere between 50-100 unfinished projects, books, games, etc in various things spread throughout my house or crammed in a closet that I pick up and put down constantly. For example- I have 5 quilts in progress. One I started five years ago, one four, one eight, one I don’t even know when, and one is from elementary school. I just feel like my hobbies never fit in with other people who also do them. Sure, I sew and quilt, but half the time have zero idea what I’m doing and forget half the terminology by the time I pick it back up. Gardening my plants tend to get about halfway through before I forget about them and they die. 

I feel like “Jack of all trades, master of none.” Definitely was made to describe someone with ADHD.  It used to really irritate me that I could never stick with something long enough  at a time to get really, really good at it- but now I’ve just kind of accepted it.

n200m5,"PSA: It's never ""too late"" to do or try anything in your life. That includes small things (like doing your laundry) or bigger things (like changing your career). The only timeline you're on is your own.",ddeftly,2790,2021-04-30 11:21:58,90,"I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but I catch myself lamenting about ""What I could've done"" all the time.

It's demoralizing and self-defeating, and definitely adds to the noise in my ADHD brain in a very noticeable way - and as someone who was only diagnosed last year, it's easy to blame ADHD as the culprit and feel a sense of self-loathing.

Lately, I've started intercepting these thoughts in an attempt to make peace with myself - my past, my now, and my future. Interestingly, doing so has helped me recognize that the core of these thoughts - the idea that I've lost an opportunity forever - is fallacious. While *some* opportunities are time sensitive, *most* are ***not***. And even those that are can typically be substituted with something similar or even better. More importantly, I don't have to feel overwhelmed or guilty for not doing something *right now*; the only timeline that matters is the timeline I set for myself.

Keep setting goals for yourself, no matter how small (or big) and keep trying. It's never ""too late"" to do anything. Sure, self-doubt, regret, and imposter syndrome are real (and they can hurt); but don't let them control your tomorrow just because they controlled your today (or yesterday, or yester-years).

I noticed some things that were different about him that I have never encountered with anyone else, like he is super communicative and says exactly what is on his mind, sounds drive him crazy, he gets distracted and can sometimes seem disconnected. He also wants sex constantly and in absurd surroundings. I saw him have a meltdown at one of his family members over a non-stick pan not sticking, which I thought was a very over-the-top reaction for the situation.

Yesterday, he got angry for the first time at me. We were sitting eating dinner at a bar and he was in his own world talking about all kinds of things and I told him he was annoying me. All I really wanted was some attention. He clearly got extremely offended and when we left he drove his sport car like a maniac and blasted the music. When we got to his house, I left and went on a 20 min walk to see if that would de-escalate things. When I got back, he was extremely angry and started yelling. He is 245lb and was acting aggressive and i didn't know how to handle it, so I left. This morning, I texted him saying I read about emotional control in ADHD and I am sorry if leaving was not the way to handle it. I told him that I would be happy to work around the anger issues, but i would need to know how to handle it in the future. He is pretty much ignoring me and still upset. This wasn't a huge deal to me, but he is unusually upset and doesn't want to see me today. He's been attentive and sweet this whole time, but I have no idea what to do...

Thank you

UPDATE: He texted me hours later telling me it was my behavior that was the problem. He said I had been distant the last few days and I shouldn't have walked away and left him there. He said he loved me and he hopes we could learn from this.

Because of all of your advice, I Googled ""abuser"" and he met almost every single piece of criteria. The possessiveness, the sexual abuse, etc. I was shocked. I never dreamed that was what this was. I thought I was totally in love with him.

Before I went to bed last night I texted him telling him that his behavior driving and afterwards was unacceptable and that I did not want to see him anymore. He responded in the middle of the night saying that he was glad because he was going to break up with me anyway and that I have anger issues! I am in disbelieve. Total shock.

I can't thank you all enough- I never even considered this to be abuse, but it makes total sense. You may have saved my life.

Notes: When I told him he was ""annoying me"" he had been difficult with the wait staff and was talking incessantly about nonsense. I said it very gently. Not in a mean way.

I read about a girl who was randomly messaging her friends and having freak outs at them for no reason. (she said there was no reason, just a way to direct her ADHD energy)

I'm reading about intense depression, and moments of extreme emotion instability, etc. ADHD might make these worse, but the intensity and complete lack of control described in some of these posts/conversations seem like either it's the worst case of ADHD in existence, or real depression or BPD being worsened by the ADHD brain. If it is the latter, then you need to get help or work on improving those other issues.

A common theme in these posts is that the OP comes to the conclusion of ""Oh I'm having psychotic freak outs, just my ADHD brain"". I think that these sort of mentalities get dangerously close to making their whole identity revolve around ADHD. If you blame every problem and every freak out on ADHD, it leaves little room to improve.

I understand that the ADHD brain works differently, but it is a functioning human brain. Many people with ADHD are incredibly smart. You can improve, and you can get help.

I'm sorry if this is hard to read for some people, but these really worry me and I thought I'd maybe make a post in hopes that at least one person benefits from it.

I don't know if it's just sheer stubbornness or self-sabotage or what, but it's like seeing all the stuff I *should* be doing sends me deeper into the ""I'm worthless and there's no point in trying"" black hole (even if I'm totally capable of doing it).

Last week, I came across an article in a business magazine with a ridiculously simple hack on getting past that: when you're resisting a to-do item, add the ""why."" Why did you even put that on the list? Like, ""brush and floss *because I don't want the hassle and expense of getting another filling right now*"" or ""send yet another follow-up email that won't get read *because I don't want to get blamed for John screwing this project up*"" or ""eat breakfast *because my meds will work better and I won't have a splitting headache by mid-afternoon*.""

1g2tzni,"I think time blindness for us with ADHD makes it very difficult to miss people, even loved ones. Have you found anything that works out for you, so you don't forget about the existence of those you love, who are not near you?",Potatoe_expert,2767,2024-10-13 09:47:24,353,"Usually we miss someone because we haven't seen them for a while. But I noticed that for me, it doesn't matter if I haven't seem then in one day, one month, or one year. It's just the same, I feel like I have seen them very recently, even though a lot of time may have passed in between. This is making it very difficult to really miss someone.

Because of this, I don't call my parents very often, or visit them. Not just parents, friends as well. Relatives. And no, it's not that I don't enjoy time with them. I do. I think it's just that most of the times, I completely forget that they exist. Even writing this sounds mental. How can I forget that they exist. But I get so caught up on my daily life that I barely remember anyone that is not near me. Unless of course there is a reason to remember them. If they come up somehow, through what I'm doing, then I remember their existence. 

So this is a strange paradox, because while I do feel that I've just met them recently and don't miss them, I also completely forget their existence, unless something reminds me of them. I tried to talk to a psychologist about this, and they've tried to attach this behavior to some sort of passed trauma. Which is a bit annoying, to be honest. Does everything nowadays need to be explained with a passed trauma or what? I didn't have any trauma that I can recall. I have very pleasant relatives. Oh, but maybe you've had some trauma that you can't recall - she said. Fuck. I guess I'll analyze the problem myself then. In my mind, time blindness is a good explanation for all this. Can't miss someone, because you don't notice passage of time. Can't remember someone because you get too caught up on something and again, don't notice the passage of time. 

It may be that not everyone feels this way. Maybe this is just my experience.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1g2tzni/i_think_time_blindness_for_us_with_adhd_makes_it/,True,False

And the earlier you start medicating the better the outcome. I feel such relief and hope that I had to share. I am almost looking forward to the next person I hear accusing parents/society of “drugging up their kids” so I can share it with them too.

I haven’t told my mom about it because she tends to react strongly and I suspected she wouldn’t be a good source of support. 

Yesterday she overheard my sister and I talking about it and completely flipped out. More than I had anticipated. “You don’t have that! They will diagnose *anyone* with that! You do NOT have that!” I pointed out that the board certified professional I’m working with disagreed with her on that, as did I, the person who actually lives inside my brain. She was completely unreachable on this. 

Had to kind of shrug it off and change the subject, but it’s affected me more than I wanted to let on to anyone, including myself. I felt numb and disconnected from my family for the remainder of my visit, and once I got home and could relax a bit my mind is swirling with self doubt about my diagnosis and pursuing treatment. I’m even feeling doubts about whether ADHD even exists, despite all the research I’ve done reading work by people far more knowledgeable and experienced than I am. 

I struggle with understanding/trusting my perceptions,  even regarding my own brain, which is why after years of flip flopping on this I decided to pay out of pocket for a psychiatrist (options were limited in my area thanks to the shitty US health care system). And yet, my imposter syndrome has not been cured despite being validated by an experienced licensed professional! 

Thanks to anyone who read this far, it was super helpful just to type this out and put words to how I’m feeling. Grateful for this forum.

UPDATE: wow, was blown away by this response. Thanks to everyone who took the time to comment or send me a DM, and I’m glad that this post was able to serve as a springboard for others to process their loved ones’ reactions. 

I texted my mom this morning and let her know that I felt hurt and invalidated by her response, and that I’d appreciate her educating herself before commenting on my ADHD. She apologized right away and admitted she had a lot of misconceptions and said she is trying to learn! We had a good and productive conversation about ADHD and some of my own struggles. (Interestingly, she related some things I mentioned to herself... I’m going to let her walk her own path with that one) 

Feeling so much better!! Side note: I think being on meds specifically helped me initiate this conversation- in the before times I believe I would have avoided it or obsessed over how to phrase my text to her, instead of easily finding words that were phrased as gentle I statements.

Something I'm really struggling with is being efficient and productive under the 9-5 model; if all I have to do for a whole day is answer one email, I will not do so until 4:50.

15t6ubb,TIL there is an opposite of ADHD.,RyanBleazard,2743,2023-08-16 17:09:35,688,"Dr Russell Barkley recently published a presentation (https://youtu.be/kRrvUGjRVsc) in which he explains the spectrum of EF/ADHD (timestamp at 18:10).

As he explains, Executive Functioning is a spectrum; specifically, a bell curve. 

The far left of the curve are the acquired cases of ADHD induced by traumatic brain injury or pre-natal alcohol or lead exposure, followed by the genetic severities, then borderline and sub-optimal cases.

The centre or mean is the typical population. 

The ones on the right side of the bell curve are people whom can just completely self-regulate themselves better than anyone else, which is in essence, the opposite of ADHD. It accounts for roughly 3-4% percent of the population, about the same percentage as ADHD (3-5%) - a little lower as you cannot acquire gifted EF (which is exclusively genetic) unlike deficient EF/ADHD (which is mostly genetic).

Medication helps to place you within the typical range of EF, or higher up if you aren't part of the normalised response.

NOTE - ADHD in reality, is Executive Functioning Deficit Disorder. The name is really outdated; akin to calling an intellectual disorder ‘comprehension deficit slow-thinking disorder’.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/15t6ubb/til_there_is_an_opposite_of_adhd/,True,False

First of all, I'd like to thank everyone that commented and messaged in my first post. 

This post got more attention than I ever thought it would, so I just thought I would share everything that has happened since and use this to check in on everyone that said that they would book their medical appointments to make sure that they actually did.

For those who are curious, I was diagnosed with Lymphoma, a very treatable type of cancer. I consider myself extremely lucky as I probably would be dead by now had I have waited this long with any other type of cancer.

A week after my diagnosis I quit my job and moved back to the UK where I am entitled to free healthcare. God bless the NHS. 

Since July I have been undergoing chemotherapy and yesterday, halfway through my treatment, I found out that I am in REMISSION!

Treatment has been pretty rough but overall, I'd say that it's better than the alternative!

A lot of people asked me what my symptoms where before being diagnosed. I had quite a few non-specific symptoms which I brushed off as something else as I didn't think they were linked:
-swollen lymph nodes
-itchy skin (legs and hands)
-brain fog
-intolerance to alcohol

However there are many other symptoms that can be more telling, such as night sweats.

Once again, please use this as a reminder to check in with your health and book that medical appointment you have been avoiding doing.

Take care everyone.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/p8rtu5/update_i_procrastinated_getting_some_swollen/,True,False

nw1q9b,Climbing out of depression has made me realize ADHD is the root cause which puts me in a negative spiral,PM_me_your_owls,2736,2021-06-09 10:44:11,163," I've dealt with severe depression but through treatment and therapy I've overcome this extremely well to the point I've literally never felt better. I've known I'm ADHD but always thought of it as a minor inconvenience in the face of more severe issues that needed immediate attention. 

 I thought my tiredness was because of depression. I've never been happier in my whole life but the waves of exhaustion don't end. I thought that my depression made me lazy it turns out I'm not lazy it's executive dysfunction. My self esteem issues grew not only from personal trauma but setting impossibly high standards for myself. Thinking back I remember my first B as a kid and how my failure to achieve perfection meant my educational future was pointless every report card reinforcing my failure.  My failure to create a perfect organizational system meant my backpack looked like a trashcan because where would I put the individual papers? Pursuing any passion was impossible because I first needed to know the exact perfect way to begin creating such a high threshold for entry that it makes doing minor things incredibly hard. It's easier hiking 30 miles down a new trail than it is to pick up the plate that fell underneath my bed because getting it invariably means I'll need to organize everything in my kitchen properly. 

 This isn't a sob story I'm doing well now and seeing the issues I have and how easily they can drag me back down into the pits makes me understand I have the wisdom to face my issues I didn't have growing up. It's empowering knowing that my issues aren't a weakness of character but an issue which others face and can be overcome through effort.

But I am a bit freaked out by RFK's comments in his hearings about kids taking too many ADHD meds, along with many other things. 

He isn't a researcher, scientist, psychopharmacologist, psychiatrist, or even a physician. For reference, my partner's father was a psychopharmacologist doing extensive studies on ADHD and various stimulants - all with good results! 

  
Anyhow, maybe I'm just freaking out. I have been going on and off stimulants for years, and at 46, I realize if I'm not taking at least some Vyvanse, I just can't even make a living. Perhaps my ADHD is especially bad, but it helps me function. I've grown too tired of working at 400% just to get the bare minimum accomplished as far as work and household chores. 

So I really hope this doesn't turn into a scenario where we don't have access to meds. A lot of people are telling me I'm overreacting.

I attached all those screenshots to a long, long email calling him out professionally as well as explaining my side of things. I also went as far as rhetorically questioning a lot of his statements in an effort to emphasize how callous and unreasonable he was being, so that not only can he process exactly what he's been telling me and reflect on it, but also for others reading the email as well. I attached my disability counsellor, him, the chair running the department, and the coordinator of the program. Within an hour, he sent a rushed email saying he didn't want to deal with this, then another email an hour later trying to save himself. I didn't say anything and let the emails sit. 2 days later, I received an email back from him saying he was talked to by his bosses and that they've decided to pass me for his class, along with an apology for how insensitive and harsh he was being.

jfp58r,"Guard your minds, there be gaslighters afoot",NessieAvery,2727,2020-10-21 17:22:49,263,"""I just want to be normal""

A common sentiment, especially for people with ADHD.  Our memories fail us, executive functioning is all out of whack, and we just seem to struggle more than the people around us.  It sucks.  And we automatically learn how to hide it, by masking.  We smile and nod through conversations when we can't process them in real time.  We take emotional cues from other people when we're not sure how much is appropriate.  And we rely on other people's memories to fill in the gaps when our own memory fails us.

But there's a danger to doing this too.

People who don't trust their own memory are prime targets for gaslighting and abuse.  It starts off small. Your friend unexpectedly announces that you'd planned to meet up with them today.  You followed all the instructions your boss gave you to the letter, but now he says that you did it all wrong.  A collegue made a bad joke at your expense and is now telling you you shouldn't be so sensitive about it.  And these are all things that people with ADHD do genuinely do - we forget, we are bad at planning, we take rejection to heart.  But if you feel like in a certain environment your ADHD is magnified more than normal, start being critical of the people around you.

Did you really plan that meeting?  You have no record of it on WhatsApp, where did that idea to meet come from?  
Your boss said that the way you've followed the instructions is all wrong, but he was never clear about them in the first place.  
And check in with a friend - was that joke out of line?  Get a second opinion.  It might not be you being overly sensitive.

Don't be afraid to trust your own memories over what others tell you.  Don't be afraid to challenge the narrative they're trying to feed you.  If it turns out they were right after all, no harm done, you tested a situation well.  Its better than feeling like your ADHD is out of control around oddly specific people, and you're going insane.

zsdyul,An ADHD trait I never see talked about: indecisiveness.,TeaWithCarina,2722,2022-12-21 21:56:29,383,"I don't know this is unusual, since most commentary about ADHD talks about impulsivity, but I (as someone with inattentive ADHD and ASD) actually had more of the exact opposite problem. 

I've always had a problem making decisions, sometimes even minor ones; it's not only that I think too much and can't sort through everything for importance, but that I just... can't commit, if that makes sense? I just get locked in this sensation of swirling unease and uncertainty, and even when I finally make a decision it doesn't feel satisfying, because I'm just sure I could've made a better one.

However, when I take dexamphetamine, that just sorta... goes away. I can look at a situation, go 'yep, that seems like the right thing to do' and do it. It's actually one of the strongest and most obvious effects of the medication, to the extent that I can often tell it's kicked in when I realise that I'm starting to come to conclusions much more clear-headedly. And even if things don't turn out too well afterwards, I don't feel so bad because I feel like I really did think it through and judged the situation as best as I could.

I suspect this is all connected to executive function. When it comes to doing tasks (e.g., how I should prioritise them) that's obvious, but I think there's a connection even with more 'pointless' things, like what combination of food and drink I should get for lunch. (Seriously, I spent a good *20 minutes* debating this with myself one time.) It's the brain fogginess, but also the difficulty pushing your brain and body into action. There's an emotional component, too: when I'm indecisive, I just feel so impossibly frustrated, which goes away completely with the dex.

Has anyone else had similar experiences? I do have issues with impulsivity too, sometimes, but that's a completely different sorta situation.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/zsdyul/an_adhd_trait_i_never_see_talked_about/,True,False

However the strength i managed to gain from reading the stories and seeing the massive positive response from all of you guys made me realise im not alone in my battles.

I explained it the best I could and how it relates to how I act, and sent her a couple videos.

“I brought up my past because I want you and need you to understand. Please do the same because I want to understand you too babe.
And I will do research, watch and read all about it.

But I want you to know that to me, you are an amazing and brilliant human being. And I will never let you forget that. 
You are incredibly smart, great and dark sense of humor like me. 
Do what makes you happy and fuck what others think. You are important. 
Thank you for explaining and sending those videos to me. It helps me understand you even better. So please keep them coming as I’ll do the same.

I love your ADHD. Better not put pressure on yourself. 
Everyone has their flaws but that is what makes us unique. 
I’m far from perfect and I don’t intend to be perfect either, fuck that. We only have one fucking life to live. 
Let me know if you are having hard time because I’m there for you. 
I don’t have ADHD but I will do my best to understand you and be there for you. 
So stop apologising you silly donut.”

I’m so happy. I’ve never met someone like this. Shout out to all the people who love someone with ADHD, it’s not always easy but we have so much love to give.

Edit: Shout out to my ADHD friends as well, this has showed me there is always someone out there for you who will love and want to understand you. I was hopeless, really. Be yourself, someone will love you for it.

yfmysc,My boyfriend has a “reminder wall” for his ADHD,None,2704,2022-10-28 05:33:31,177,"My boyfriend has a “reminder wall” for his ADHD

And its the cutest thing ever. We first started dating a little over two months ago, when I got into this with him he wanted me to know ahead of time that he has ADHD. I have no problem with it so i was glad to despite him feeling like its a burden.

Flash forward to now, he’s been wanting to improve more in every day mundane things. Things like “eat more good food” and “don’t sleep in.” Other things too like getting a good paying job, learning to be more tidy and on the ball. So, I woke up this morning to his reminder wall. He taped his to do list, important items, and journal and things like his keys to the wall. 

Now heres what got me: I am his first “real” relationship. He was only with girls for shorter than 1 month before, so this is all new to him. I told him I’ll show him the ropes and encourage him by doing the same in return, and ive been voicing things I would like him to do more. Things like showing more affection, initiating more, so on. 

This man has a separate column on his wall for me that includes a list of what he would like to improve on for me. FOR ME. when i tell you I almost cried happy tears. He put things like “go on more dates :)” “show more affection” “make more eye contact”. The most amazing thing I could ask for from this man. Couldn’t ask for a better s/o <3

Just wanted to share the innocence that is my boyfriend and how the right person WILL fight for your relationship, even in the simplest ways.

1amoby7,I hate the lack of representation for inattentive ADHD,BonkyBinkyBum,2693,2024-02-09 05:38:26,449,"I just watched a news story about ADHD drug shortages, and they interviewed 2 people with ADHD who have hyperactive ADHD, and both were portrayed as 'problem' children who need their meds. The boy was interviewed and said ""I hate how I am off my meds and how I harm people, and I'm worried what I could do"", and the girl was sat in her living room calling out random words and inspecting a fidget toy.

I'm not invalidating these 2 children's struggles, but that is *not* how my ADHD presents. Sure, I've had moments like that, but for the most part I stare out of a window and have trouble keeping track of  conversations, and focusing with everyday work is a massive struggle. I'm fed up of feeling like inattentive ADHD continues to go unnoticed and unrecognised in media. As an adult, it's even more difficult to be taken seriously, because it's like as soon as school/university and exams are over, society expects you to not have any problems anymore.

Edit: I also wanted to tag on here that, come to think of it, I don't always agree with the ways hyperactive ADHD'ers are portrayed in the media either. Even the representation we *do* have still seems quite misguided and taken out of context a lot of the time. I think the young lad they interviewed was talking about the harm he may do to *himself*, but with the recent media publicity I've heard about screening in prisons, and ADHD mentioned during murder trials, it sounded like he was worried about the harm he might cause to others violently.

My ADHD diagnosis hit me way harder and I sobbed. I sobbed to my sister whose always been so critical of my inability to function and she basically told me I was too sensitive(another blow to my ADHD).

But my fibromyalgia diagnosis? My sister teared up. She told me I’ve had the symptoms since my bio mom died when I was 14 and she felt bad she never took my symptoms seriously(meanwhile I was failing high school bc of ADHD). My father blames himself(he has ADHD that he refuses to get diagnosed). People give me so much sympathy for the physical illness and many people are just shocked because I’m young. 

I’m just so frustrated. Like I can’t even get out of bed without my adderall. I can’t maintain my home without my Wellbutrin and adderall. Can’t manage my classes, remember appts, concentrate at work.

A few weeks ago I was watching a physical therapist on youtube talking about issues similar to what I have and showed a few stretches and recommended a massage wand for working out tight muscles that could be causing the problem.

I decided to purchase a percussion massager and give it a try. Within the first few minutes I'd worked out a major knot in my shoulder that was causing further tension in my neck, which I then proceeded to work out.

As I got each muscle loosened I realized how tight the ones next to it are.

Over about an hour period I discovered that pretty much my entire back and neck were so tense and tight all of the time that I had no idea it was even happening.

I feel like I'm two inches taller and so much pain has been alleviated.

asmlxq,3 Things Nobody Explained to me About ADHD.,gay_gypsy_barmitzvah,2675,2019-02-20 02:02:13,404,"I recently listened to an ADHD podcast where a psychiatrist spoke at length about ADHD and in a nutshell this is what he said. 

There are 3 pieces of ADHD:

1. **People with ADHD have a nervous system that works perfectly well.** He never found anything they couldn’t do. But it works on the basis of interest, challenge, novelty, urgency (and perhaps passion). It doesn’t work at all on importance, rewards, and consequences (which is what “neurotypical” brains respond to) 

2. **Rejection sensitive dysphoria.** Intense emotional response to the perception (not necessarily the reality) of rejection, teasing, or criticizing by others. 

3. **Internal sense of hyperarousal.** Moods created by ADHD are almost always triggered by events and perceptions, and resolve very quickly. They are normal moods in every way except for their intensity.

I hope this provides you some insight like it did for me. 

Take care all. 

EDIT: I can’t mention the name of the podcast, because as someone else tried, automod will delete it. The guest psychiatrist was William Dodson, MD.  

EDIT2: Maybe it’s the internal sense of hyperarousal, lol, but I’m tearing up over here about the Platinum. I made this post to share information that made sense to me, and hearing other people in the comments have the same response I initially did fills my heart. Then, platinum? I’m very grateful.

He asked a few questions, had me do some tests on a computer (reaction time and processing visual and auditory input), and gave me three ADHD questionnaires to fill out, which I did.

At the end of the assessment, he said he didn't think I would be helped with another diagnosis (already got recurring depression and emotional instability), and that it would be better for me to narrow my focus to the depression rather than broadening it to include ADHD. As I had no problems with attention on the computer tests, he said medication would not be helpful for me. He wrote a letter to my psychiatrist with his assessment.

I questioned his assessment, but my psychiatrist said that a person with ADHD, after answering about five questions, would have been too inattentive and confused to understand the questions in the questionnaires or answer them correctly like I did. Therefore, I do not have ADHD.

I've recently starting tracking my work hours using an app, and I work around 20 hours a week, 30 maximum on weeks I've been hyperfocusing.

My question is how the hell are people able to work for 40 hours every week?

Some days I wake up feeling motivated, energized and so on, start working, and after 1 or 2 I already get bored of whatever I'm doing, feel an urge for dopamine (usually sugar) and can't stay focused and keep my discipline in check to actually power through. And some other days are lost in advance where I wake up late, feel like shit, convincing myself that the day is already over since I didn't manage to do my usual routine, and without even being able to rest guilt-free, which means I'm more tired and feel worse mentally than before.

I don't know where I'm going with this, I guess I'd like to know whether it's normal (even for people with ADHD), and if it is, how you guys manage it.

I basically find it next to impossible to leave the house to do basic stuff, like get groceries, get a haircut etc.. 

Recently figured out that one of the reasons for this is how I use my clothes, and what I wear and when... Yes, really.

SO up until yesterday, I had two sets of clothes: Outside Clothes, and Inside Clothes. (Also had Fancy Clothes but they're not relevant).

I wear OC when I wanna leave the house to do something basic, and I wear IC at ALL OTHER TIMES. I also sleep in them. They're basically glorified pyjamas. 

(Fancy Clothes are for going out with friends, dates, and similar stuff, when I wanna look nice basically)

But I sweat a lot while I'm sleeping, so my IC are usually to stinky for me to even consider leaving the house in. Which means I ALWAAAAYS have to change before going out. And this has been a major barrier for me, and has basically disincentivised me from leaving the house.

What I did yesterday, after doing my laundry, was this:

Instead of separating clothes into Outside Clothes and Inside Clothes, I separated them into Day Clothes and Night Clothes. AKA I change only when I wake up, and go to sleep. I no longer have to change when leaving the house for stuff like groceries.

I know it sounds stupid but I immediately saw major improvements thanks to this new system. It's very easy to leave the house now. I don't procrastrinate anymore.

ytfjpp,I have hyper focused on ADHD research for about 10 years on and off. This is what I learned,atherises,2630,2022-11-12 11:04:51,297," 

TLDR because this is an ADHD thread: Speed reading increases comprehension. Link habits to fun things. Diet is helpful. Invite a friend to sit while you are productive. Combine your habit triggers. Meditation teaches focus. Don't stimulate your brain between productive tasks. If out of control, practice intentional boredom. Medication is great

\*Reading slower doesn't help me with comprehension. But in many cases, speed reading uses a different part of your brain that tends to be over developed in ADHD brains. This can increase both speed, and comprehension with practice.

\*Reading forms habits before you have even done a task once. Read about what you need to improve. Sometimes TV shows work as well. Watch shows about your goals. There are several on cleaning the house, or investing, or basically everything.

\*Habits don't form without dopamine. Try to link boring habits to something that produces dopamine, but doesn't require the same part of the brain. For example, reading/studying you can listen to music without words. Cleaning you can listen to any music, audiobook, or even a TV show if it doesn't distract too much. In high school when listening to lectures, I would solve Rubik's cubes. You just need to use a different part of the brain than your main focus.

\*Diet is important, but I'm a hypocrite so I couldn't tell you exactly what to eat off the top of my head. But worth researching if you feel motivated to do so.

\*often we are people oriented. Invite a friend over to literally just sit and hang out with you while being productive. Or offer a time trade where they help you with something, then you help them. You will have more motivation cleaning your friends house than your own. But having somebody there keeps you focused.

\*Link your habit triggers together. A habit always forms around a trigger. Find out what triggers your currently built habits, and add to that same habit. Forming new ones takes too long with a shortage of dopamine.

\*A single meditation session of 15 minutes has been shown To permanently reduce metal gaps in focus. And yes I said permanently. As in forever. Meditation is great for taking a short break from dopamine and regulating it better.

\*If you need a break from work, don't use that break time with a stimulating activity like games. You will always believe you can get back to work, but it never works that way. Take your break to relax, not to stimulate your brain.

\*You will probably have times in your life where you feel enslaved to your brain. Constantly craving stimulation and seeking it constantly just to feel okay.. Consider intentional boredom. There are plenty of great effects from teaching your brain to be bored on purpose. This expands creativity and focus. And has been shown to improve motivation. This can be something as simple as 10 minutes a day. Some people like to avoid stimulation until noon or so to be productive without distraction. or if you feel really dedicated to it, I am currently on a 3 week break from pretty much all stimulation (I'm cheating a bit with reddit.)  It's always helpful to take a step away from stimulators like sugar, videogames, social media, and movies. Find what works to get your brain in check.   


\* Last but not least, ADHD is extremely well researched, and the medications are proven. Under the direction of a doctor you trust, there is no problem at all with medication. Often time the first 3 weeks are the hardest with side effects, and many people need to try 5 or 6 meds before they find the right fit.

When a person with no clinical need abuses prescription medicine, they can similarly destroy/alter their neurons so that they BECOME dependent.

urx6nr,IMO: Banning telehealth providers from prescribing stimulants will hurt more people than it will help,arrownyc,2609,2022-05-17 14:42:31,493,"I'm pretty frustrated about the recent crackdown on stimulants prescribed via telehealth for the treatment of ADHD. I understand stimulants can be addictive and come with risks. I do believe there should be appropriate regulations to ensure medications are prescribed thoughtfully. But that's not what's happening - instead its just blanket bans.

[Walmart and CVS are blocking telehealth prescriptions.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-cvs-pharmacies-have-blocked-or-delayed-telehealth-adderall-prescriptions-11651082131)

[Truepill and Cerebral will stop prescribing or filling prescriptions.](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/truepill-cerebral-stop-prescribing-adderall-new-adhd-patients-amid-reports-mental)

The primary reasons cited by the investigation are the increase in new diagnoses/prescriptions during the pandemic, and the prevalence of ADHD-related content on social media platforms like Tiktok and Instagram.

[But its a known fact that the pandemic amplified mental health issues.](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/#:~:text=During%20the%20COVID%2D19%20pandemic,largely%20stable%20since%20spring%202020)

[Its also a known fact that women have been chronically underdiagnosed for ADD/ADHD.](https://chadd.org/adhd-news/adhd-news-adults/how-the-gender-gap-leaves-girls-and-women-undertreated-for-adhd/)

Preventing telehealth providers from prescribing to their patients will leave many uninsured or underinsured people without access to medication. It will also put many women (and others diagnosed during the pandemic) in the challenging situation of convincing another provider that their diagnosis was legitimate. For women, who often exhibit less obvious symptoms of ADHD because they cope and mask differently than men, this will create an uphill battle. Many prescribers, as a result of this media coverage, may be likely to challenge existing diagnoses and hesitant to fill prescriptions. They may perceive and treat new patients as drug-seeking addicts for their legitimate medical concerns.

Its really unfortunate that the situation is being handled this way. I feel like the DEA/DOJ/media are invalidating my personal experience as a woman with a clear and obvious history of ADHD since childhood, who desperately needed treatment my entire life and never received it, who had to reach a point of complete and total desperation during the pandemic in order to finally find the care I had needed for a lifetime.

In my opinion, Cerebral, Ahead and other telehealth providers represented a big step forward for getting people (and especially women) the mental healthcare they needed, and this latest development will move us all two steps back.",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/urx6nr/imo_banning_telehealth_providers_from_prescribing/,True,False
o711u4,Being treated like a drug addict in the emergency room bc of my ADHD meds,eiksnaglesn,2613,2021-06-24 06:37:58,409,"I want to start off by saying that emergency room doctors shouldn't dismiss anyone's symptoms no matter if they're a drug addict or not, it was just especially infuriating when I was just taking my prescription medication in the exact way my doctors had told me to. TLDR in the bottom!

So basically, I've been having some weird visual hallucinations for maybe a year or so, it started with seeing caleidoscopic patterns on walls and ceilings when I woke up at night. They usually went away after about 5-10 minutes and I didn't think much of it.

A few weeks ago it started increasing in strength and came more and more often. I also started seeing flashes of light when I moved my head quickly, usually after working out, I saw movements in the edge of my vision(for example I kept thinking some small holes in the ceiling were crawling spiders, but when I looked directly at them the movement stopped) and I thought there was a beetle on my bf's arm cause I saw a dark spot there but when I blinked and looked it disappeared. I still didn't really think anything of it until a few days ago when I started seeing flickering rings of light at the edge of my vision when I turned my head or moved my eyes. I called my healthcare center in the morning the day after and they told me to go check it out immediately, so I did.

I told the emergency room nurses and doctor that I took 70 mg elvanse for my ADHD right away and also mentioned I hadn't gotten a lot of sleep for a few days. The doctor literally told me I ""seemed doped up"" and proceeded to angrily berate me for taking a too high dosage of elvanse even though I was just following my doctor's prescription (I can kind of understand the doped up comment tbh, I'm pretty sure I give off pepe silvia vibes whenever I try to explain anything even when I'm not sleep deprived and running exclusively on caffeine and stimulants). To her credit she backed off a lot when I got upset and actually took me seriously enough to order a CT scan and an eye exam right away after that. I'm really grateful for that, but I'm kind of pissed that she acted like it was my fault my dosage was off. I would love to have more regular consultations about my meds and dosage and easier access to medical help with my ADHD but unfortunately our healthcare system is garbage so that's not how it works.

I've heard about other people being treated crappy by healthcare workers bc of their ADHD meds but this was a first for me.

**TLDR**; Had visual hallucinations, got told to seek medical help immediately, ER doctor told me I ""seemed doped up"" and angrily berated me for taking a too high dosage despite just following my doctor's prescription.

**EDIT** this post kind of blew up while I was playing dnd yesterday(anyone wanna talk about curse of strahd?) and I haven't been able to keep up with the comments! I'm so thankful for all the love and support you're all giving me and other people in the community, thank you so much!<3

I've tried answering comments as best I can but I want to clear up some of the most asked questions and comments!

1. Luckily my CT scan and eye exam both came out looking normal so they concluded it's probably an ocular migraine caused by stress, they just wanted to rule out something more serious like a detached retina or a brain tumor. I'll probably get beta blockers for a while to treat it so hopefully that's the end of it!
2. I started having these hallucinations long before I even started taking elvanse, the doctor just attributed the increased intensity to a change in my dosage at first, but they didn't completely coincide so they weren't sure. I have a scheduled meeting with my doctor next week and will discuss my dosage with her then! Most likely stress is the main factor, I've had a really stressful few months, but since I actually have a lot of free time this summer I'll hopefully be able to rest a bit.
3. I don't think sleep deprivation plays a huge part in my problem, I usually sleep pretty alright with my meds and I still have the migraines. It probably doesn't help but it's not the main cause. I wasn't having the migraines/hallucinations while I was in the ER either which I told them several times
4. Several people commented that mixing caffeine and stimulants isn't great and I agree, I'm definitely not as cautious as I could and should be. None of my doctors warned me about mixing elvanse with pretty much anything so I had a pretty lax approach to it from the start and that mindset has stayed with me. It's stupid I know, but I don't think I'm taking any huge risks, I drink coffee with it and occasionally alcohol but I'd never mix it with anything else.
5. I am extremely far sighted(+9 strength glasses hell yeah) so my shitty eyesight puts a lot of strain on my eyes too. I need new glasses but they're really expensive so atm I'm making do with my contacts that are slightly better, but I feel like this is probably my sign that it's time to actually get new glasses.
6. Oh, and I didn't put my meds up my ass, I'm just bad at prepositions lmfao

What she doesn't know is I spoke with a psychiatrist a few weeks ago and got diagnosed. I'm going to start taking Vyvanse tomorrow. 

When I explain why I believe I may have ADHD, she says she has those problems too. For example, if I can't get out of bed in the morning or show up on time for things, her response is, “sometimes I'm late too, so do I have ADHD?” and it's frustrating to hear that because I've lost really good jobs because I would be late constantly I flunked out of college because I couldn't show up to classes and when I was in courses I couldn't focus.
